Jackson Women's Health Organization, based on the framework provided, indicates that the Citing Case seeks to overturn the constitutional principles and framework established by the Cited Case.

American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, affirms the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade and refines the application of this right by evaluating the constitutionality of specific state regulations. It does so by examining whether the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act's provisions unduly infringe upon the right to privacy and the ability to obtain an abortion, as protected under Roe. The Citing Case reinforces the importance of Roe's framework in evaluating abortion regulations and ensures that state laws do not undermine the constitutional protections afforded to women.

This favorable citation supports Ultramercial's argument for the patent eligibility of its claimed method under § 101. The use of In re Alappat's principles in Ultramercial's analysis underscores the continued relevance and applicability of these principles to the patentability of computer-implemented inventions.

Shepard, 125 F. Supp. 2d 562, it is evident that the Citing Case vacates the district court's decision and remands the case for resentencing based on a disagreement with the district court's interpretation of legal precedents regarding the consideration of police reports and complaint applications. The Citing Case clarifies the application of the categorical approach to sentencing under the ACCA, specifically in relation to what evidence can be considered to determine the nature of prior convictions. Therefore, the most appropriate classification of the relationship between these cases is 'vacated'. This classification is supported by the Citing Case's explicit action to vacate the district court's ruling and its directive to remand the case for further proceedings, indicating a clear intention to nullify the previous judgment and remove its legal effect.

Anderson (the Citing Case) and Anderson v. Griswold (the Cited Case) is best classified as 'overturned'. The Supreme Court in Trump v. Anderson directly reverses the Colorado Supreme Court's decision in Anderson v.

North Dakota, it is evident that the Citing Case refines the legal principles established in the Cited Case. Birchfield v. North Dakota builds upon the totality of the circumstances approach from State v. McNeely to further delineate the constitutionality of warrantless blood and breath tests in DUI investigations.

 "
State v. McNeely,358 S.W.3d 65,Missouri v. McNeely,569 U.S. 141,likely_good,likely_good,"The relationship between the Cited Case, State v. McNeely, and the Citing Case, Missouri v. McNeely, is best classified as affirmed. The U.S. Supreme Court in the Citing Case explicitly affirms the judgment of the Missouri Supreme Court in the Cited Case. It supports the lower court's decision that the natural dissipation of blood-alcohol content does not automatically constitute an exigency sufficient to justify a warrantless blood draw under the Fourth Amendment. The Citing Case reinforces the legal principles established by the Cited Case without modification, making affirmed the most appropriate classification.
 "
State v. McNeely,358 S.W.3d 65,Mitchell v. Wisconsin,139 S. Ct. 2525,caution,caution,"Upon analyzing the relationship between State v. McNeely and Mitchell v. Wisconsin, it is evident that Mitchell v. Wisconsin refines the legal principles established in McNeely. While McNeely set a precedent that the natural dissipation of blood-alcohol evidence alone does not automatically justify a warrantless blood draw, Mitchell v. Wisconsin builds upon this by clarifying that in the context of unconscious drivers, the exigent circumstances rule almost always permits a blood test without a warrant. This refinement adds nuance to the exigent circumstances exception as it applies to a specific category of DUI cases, thereby extending the original principles to new factual scenarios without altering their foundational nature.

Day, does not directly engage with the legal principles or findings of the Cited Case, Javor v. United States.
