Jackson Women's Health Organization, based on the framework provided, indicates that the Citing Case seeks to overturn the constitutional principles and framework established by the Cited Case.

The Citing Case reinforces the importance of Roe's framework in evaluating abortion regulations and ensures that state laws do not undermine the constitutional protections afforded to women.

Shepard, 125 F.

North Dakota builds upon the totality of the circumstances approach from State v. McNeely to further delineate the constitutionality of warrantless blood and breath tests in DUI investigations.

McNeely, is best classified as affirmed. The U.S. Supreme Court in the Citing Case explicitly affirms the judgment of the Missouri Supreme Court in the Cited Case.

 "
State v. McNeely,358 S.W.3d 65,Mitchell v. Wisconsin,139 S. Ct. 2525,caution,caution,"Upon analyzing the relationship between State v. McNeely and Mitchell v. Wisconsin, it is evident that Mitchell v. Wisconsin refines the legal principles established in McNeely. While McNeely set a precedent that the natural dissipation of blood-alcohol evidence alone does not automatically justify a warrantless blood draw, Mitchell v. Wisconsin builds upon this by clarifying that in the context of unconscious drivers, the exigent circumstances rule almost always permits a blood test without a warrant. This refinement adds nuance to the exigent circumstances exception as it applies to a specific category of DUI cases, thereby extending the original principles to new factual scenarios without altering their foundational nature.

Day, does not directly engage with the legal principles or findings of the Cited Case, Javor v. United States.
