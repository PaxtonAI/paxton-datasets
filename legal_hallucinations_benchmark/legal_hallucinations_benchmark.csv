The case involved Carlos Marcello, who challenged the legality of his deportation proceedings, arguing that they violated the Administrative Procedure Act and due process among other claims. The Supreme Court, however, found that the deportation proceedings against Marcello were conducted in accordance with the law, specifically noting that the procedures prescribed by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 were the sole and exclusive procedure for deportation proceedings, effectively superseding the hearing provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Court also rejected Marcello's due process claims, concluding that the special inquiry officer's connection to the Immigration and Naturalization Service did not deprive Marcello of a fair hearing.",1,0,0

The appellants, Joseph Hamme and R.H. Hamme, argued that the transaction was a sale, but the Tax Court and subsequently the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Hammes retained an economic interest in the mining properties, which meant the income had to be treated as royalties.

The Transportation Company, 70 U.S. 150 (1865), the Supreme Court of the United States reversed the decision of the lower court. The case involved a dispute over the liability of a ship owner for cargo destroyed by fire. The Supreme Court, with Mr. Justice Miller delivering the opinion, held that under the Act of Congress of March 3, 1851, ship owners were not liable for losses by fire caused by the negligence of the ship's officers or agents unless the owners had directly participated in the negligence. The Court also clarified that the statute allowed for parties to make contracts extending or limiting the liability of the owner, but in this case, there was no evidence of an express contract to that effect, and the alleged custom that ship owners would be liable was not supported by law [2].
 

 The Supreme Court's decision focused on the interpretation of the Act of Congress and the absence of a proven express contract or custom that would hold the ship owners liable for the negligence of their agents in cases of fire. The reversal indicates that the Supreme Court found the ship owner not liable under the specific circumstances of this case, contrary to the lower court's decision.",0,1,0

Thompson, 32 U.S. 348 (1833) affirm or reverse the lower court's decision?",affirm,"In the Supreme Court case *Hollingsworth Magniac and Others, Plaintiffs in Error v. John R. Thompson*, 32 U.S. 348 (1833), the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision in favor of the defendant, John R. Thompson. The case revolved around the validity of certain marriage settlement articles made in contemplation of Thompson's marriage to Miss Annis Stockton. The plaintiffs, Hollingsworth Magniac and Others, were creditors of Thompson and challenged the marriage settlement as a fraud upon creditors. The core issue was whether the marriage settlement was made with the intent to defraud creditors by withdrawing or attempting to withdraw property from their reach.
 

 The Supreme Court, through Mr. Justice Story, delivered the opinion that the marriage settlement was valid and not fraudulent. The Court emphasized that for a transaction to be tainted with fraud, both parties must concur in the illegal design. It was not enough to prove fraud in the debtor alone; unless the purchaser or preferred creditor (in this case, the wife and her trustee) received the property with the same fraudulent design, the contract would remain valid against other creditors or purchasers who might be injured by the transaction [5].
 

 The Court also clarified that marriage, in contemplation of the law, is not only a valuable consideration to support such a settlement but is a consideration of the highest value. Thus, the husband and wife, parties to such a contract, are deemed in the highest sense purchasers for a valuable consideration. So long as the transaction was bona fide and without notice of fraud brought home to both sides, it becomes unimpeachable by creditors [7].
 

 Furthermore, the Court addressed objections related to the delivery of notes to Captain Robert Stockton in September 1829 and the non-registration of the marriage articles within the time prescribed by the laws of New Jersey. The Court found no error in these parts of the lower court's charge, stating that if the delivery of the notes was made in part performance of the marriage articles, bona fide, and without fraud, it was a discharge of a moral as well as a legal duty. The Court also noted that marriage articles or settlements, as such, are not required by the laws of New Jersey to be recorded at all, but only conveyances of real estate. Thus, the non-registration of the articles did not affect their validity [9].
 

 In conclusion, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's judgment in favor of John R. Thompson, holding that the marriage settlement was valid and not fraudulent against creditors.",1,0,0

Brown et al., dba Brown Food Store, et al., 380 U.S. 278 (1965), the U.S. Supreme Court decided to affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. The Supreme Court's ruling was based on the conclusion that the respondents' conduct, which involved locking out their employees and using temporary replacements during a whipsaw strike, did not violate sections 8(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act as the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had found. The Court of Appeals had disagreed with the NLRB's finding and refused to enforce the Board's order, a decision that the Supreme Court upheld. The Supreme Court reasoned that the respondents' actions were motivated by legitimate business purposes and did not inherently discourage union membership or demonstrate anti-union animus, thus not constituting unfair labor practices under the Act [1].",1,0,0

Lawrence Kingsland, Isaac Lightner, and James Cuddy, Partners, Doing Business Under the Firm of Kingsland, Lightner, and Cuddy*, 42 U.S. 202 (1843), the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. The case revolved around a patent dispute where the Court had to consider whether an employee, who invented something while employed and using the employer's resources, had implicitly granted a license to the employer to use the invention. The Supreme Court held that the facts of the case justified the presumption of a license or grant to the defendants to use the invention, thereby protecting them from liability. This decision was based on the understanding that the employee, while employed and compensated by the employer, made the invention using the employer's resources and allowed the employer to use the invention without demanding compensation or indicating otherwise until a dispute arose. The Court's opinion emphasized that the defendants had a right to the continued use of the improvement patented to Harley, as the facts of the case had equal effect with a license, and the evidence brought the defendant under the protection of the act of 1839 due to the unmolested notorious use of the invention before the application for a patent [3].",1,0,0

Michelle Bazzetta et al.*, 539 U.S. 126 (2003), the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the lower court regarding prison visitation policies [2]. The Supreme Court held that the regulations limiting prison visitation bore a rational relation to legitimate penological interests, which sufficed to sustain them regardless of whether the respondents had a constitutional right of association that survived incarceration. The Court accorded substantial deference to the professional judgment of prison administrators, who bear a significant responsibility for defining the corrections system's legitimate goals and determining the most appropriate means to accomplish them. The regulations were found to satisfy the criteria used to decide whether a prison regulation affecting a constitutional right that survives incarceration withstands constitutional challenge.

The case involved a tragic mid-air collision that resulted in fatalities, with the plaintiffs suing the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, claiming negligence on the part of federally employed air traffic controllers. The district court found the United States 20 percent at fault due to the controllers' failure to adequately monitor the airspace, leading to the collision. The appellate court, in its review, upheld the district court's application of comparative negligence principles and its findings on the breaches of duty by both the air traffic controllers and the pilots involved. Additionally, the court affirmed the district court's approach to damages and the application of joint and several liability, which required the United States to pay significant portions of the damages awarded to the plaintiffs, despite being found only 20 percent at fault.

This case was notable for being an appeal by two securities purchasers from a preliminary injunction obtained by the Securities and Exchange Commission in a case of alleged insider trading.

Wheeler then brought the case to the Supreme Court by a writ of error. The Supreme Court, in its analysis, found no evidence that the bank charged more than the current rate of exchange and, therefore, did not declare a forfeiture under the National Currency Act of June 3, 1864. The Court emphasized that a forfeiture should not be declared unless the facts upon which it must rest are clearly established. Since there was no proof of the rate of exchange and the courts incline against the declaration of a forfeiture, the party seeking such declaration should make convincing proof of every fact essential to forfeiture.

Godfrey, 8 U.S. 321 (1807), the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. The case centered on whether a subject of Great Britain, born before the Declaration of Independence, could inherit lands in the United States. The Supreme Court, through the opinion delivered by Justice Johnson, concluded that the right to inherit depends upon the existing state of allegiance at the time of the descent cast. Since the antenati of Great Britain never owed allegiance to the U.S. government, they could not inherit lands in the U.S. This decision upheld the lower court's instruction that Mrs. Dawson, being an alien, could not take the land by descent from Russel Lee in the year 1793 [1].",1,0,0

The appellate court considered whether the Anchor Liquor Company committed an offense against the laws of the United States by evading the maximum price for Teachers Scotch Whiskey established by Maximum Price Regulation No. 445, pursuant to the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942. The company had entered a plea of nolo contendere to an information charging it with such evasion.

Mandeville, 11 U.S. 208, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The case involved a dispute over a promissory note where the plaintiff, Sheehy, was unable to produce the exact note described in the declaration. The lower court had instructed the jury to presume the note had been paid or passed away unless the plaintiff could produce the note or account for its absence, leading to the jury awarding nominal damages of one cent. Sheehy brought the case to the Supreme Court on a writ of error.
 

 Chief Justice Marshall delivered the opinion of the Supreme Court, which held that the variance between the note declared upon and the note produced was not material and that evidence outside the bill was admissible to prove that the bill produced was the one intended in the declaration. The Supreme Court found that on a writ of enquiry, the production of the note was unnecessary, and the variance was not fatal to the plaintiff's case [1],[2].
 

 Therefore, the Supreme Court's decision was to reverse the judgment of the lower court, which had refused to allow the plaintiff to read the note in evidence and had instructed the jury to award only nominal damages.",0,1,0

The lower court had initially dismissed the suit, holding that no cause of action was stated. However, upon appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision, holding that a cause of action was adequately stated, and directed that the complaint be permitted to be filed. The Supreme Court, upon reviewing the case, affirmed the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals, thereby supporting the United States' right to sue on behalf of an Indian ward to assert and enforce his interest in property diverted from a trust fund while being administered by the Government's officers [1].",1,0,0

However, if you are looking for information on how appellate courts generally handle appeals, I can explain that the United States Court of Appeals reviews the decisions of lower courts and may either affirm or reverse those decisions. An affirmation means the appellate court agrees with the lower court's decision, while a reversal means the appellate court disagrees and overturns the lower court's ruling.

Specifically, the appellate court disagreed with the trial court's construction of the trust instrument and the legal effect of the Henderson transaction. The appellate court held that May Kelley Schneider, by the Henderson transaction and the earlier demise of Arthur B. Kelley, became vested with the entire five-sixths legal and equitable interests in the land in controversy, except for the one-sixth interest owned by John M. Kelley. Consequently, the appellate court directed the lower court to enter judgment declaring May Kelley Schneider the owner of a five-sixths undivided interest in the land, with the remaining one-sixth undivided interest to be awarded to the plaintiffs claiming under John M.

The appellate court agreed with the trial court's resolution of the dispute, including its interpretation of the contract and its findings on the patent applications' value and the denial of attorney's fees.

The court also determined that the doctrines of ""fortuity"" and ""known loss"" did not bar coverage in this case, and that neither Stroh nor Heileman breached the policy's due diligence, cooperation, or disclosure provisions.

The plaintiffs contended that these requirements violated the Supremacy Clause, the Equal Protection clause, and the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as state law.

The appellate court agreed with the trial court's award of summary judgment in favor of both defendants, Dillon Companies, Inc. and the union, on the ground that the plaintiff, Myrna Varra, had failed to exhaust internal union remedies before bringing her suit [1]. 
 

 The court found that Varra's failure to exhaust internal union remedies precluded her civil suit against the union for breach of the duty of fair representation, as there was no allegation or proof that resort to those procedures would be futile [1]. Additionally, the appellate court determined that the employer, Dillon Companies, Inc., could not be required to allow an employee to bypass the union appeal process and that the employer could raise the exhaustion defense in this case [2].

The Supreme Court found that the exclusion of jurors who were unable to take an oath that the mandatory penalty of death or life imprisonment would not affect their deliberations on any issue of fact was inconsistent with the principles established in Witherspoon.

 The Supreme Court held that there is no implied right of action under the FWPCA and MPRSA, emphasizing that the elaborate enforcement provisions within both Acts indicate that Congress did not intend to authorize by implication additional judicial remedies for private citizens suing under these Acts [1]. Furthermore, the Court found that the federal common law of nuisance has been fully preempted in the area of water pollution by the FWPCA and, to the extent ocean waters not covered by the FWPCA are involved, by the MPRSA [1].

The court found that there was substantial credible evidence to support the NLRB's conclusion that the discharges of employees were motivated by their participation in protected union activities, rather than the reasons asserted by the employer. The court's decision emphasized the credibility of evidence indicating that the real reason for the employees' dismissal was their involvement in a letter of protest against the company's practices, which was considered protected activity under the National Labor Relations Act.

Firstly, it was determined that the original ""royalty"" deed did not nullify Davis' potential to receive a full 3/8 undivided interest in the land in question. Additionally, the court found that certain corrections could clarify Davis' interest, and notably, the corrective deed filed by the plaintiffs effectively ""cleared up"" any ambiguity involving the reservation that created uncertainty in the original instrument entitled ""Royalty Deed"" relating to plaintiffs' oil, gas, and mineral interest in the lands [1],[2].
 

 This decision underscores the appellate court's agreement with the lower court's judgment that the uncertainty regarding the original royalty deed did not constitute an absolute defense for Davis relative to his obligations as the lessee under the lease contract. The appellate court also concurred with the trial court's findings that neither fraud, mistake, nor misrepresentation were present, and that the cloud on plaintiffs' title only gave rise to an obligation on the part of plaintiffs to protect and defend their represented title upon demand [2].

However, the Court held that on a trial for subornation of perjury, the falsity of the testimony charged as perjury cannot be proved by the unsupported testimony of the alleged subornee alone.

United States*, 256 F.2d 73 (1958), the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals did not explicitly state whether it affirmed or reversed the lower court's decision in the provided context. However, the detailed discussion in the case focuses on the applicability of the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act and the Marihuana Tax Act to Puerto Rico, and the court's reasoning aligns with maintaining the application of these acts in Puerto Rico. The court discussed the legislative history and the intention of Congress regarding the application of these acts to Puerto Rico, indicating a thorough examination of the legal framework rather than a simple affirmation or reversal of the lower court's decision [1].
 

 The court's analysis included references to previous cases and legislative actions that demonstrated a clear intention by Congress to apply the Marihuana Tax Act to Puerto Rico. This included the continuation of the act's application even after Puerto Rico became a Commonwealth and the cooperation between federal and Puerto Rican authorities in enforcing narcotics legislation. The court also referenced a previous case, *Moreno Rios v. United States*, which was decided on the same day and dealt with similar issues regarding the applicability of federal narcotics laws to Puerto Rico, suggesting a consistent approach by the court in these matters [1],[7].
 

 Given the context and the court's detailed discussion on the applicability of federal narcotics laws to Puerto Rico, it can be inferred that the court's decision was more focused on clarifying legal principles and the scope of federal laws in Puerto Rico rather than simply affirming or reversing the lower court's decision based on procedural grounds. Therefore, without a direct statement of affirmation or reversal, the decision primarily contributes to the legal understanding of federal narcotics laws' application in Puerto Rico.",0,0,1

The lower courts, including the Bankruptcy Court, the District Court, and the Court of Appeals, had concluded that the obligation had been converted into a monetary obligation, which was dischargeable in bankruptcy. The Supreme Court agreed with this assessment, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals. The Court reasoned that once a receiver was appointed and took control of the site and Kovacs' assets, Kovacs was effectively dispossessed and could no longer fulfill the cleanup obligation through personal performance. Instead, the only performance sought from Kovacs was the payment of money to defray cleanup costs, making the obligation dischargeable in bankruptcy [1],[2],[3],[4].",1,0,0

The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the District Court had erred in resentencing the defendants on the counts which had been affirmed. The appellate court held that the District Court, after an appellate court has affirmed convictions on certain counts and reversed convictions on other counts, does not have the authority to enter a new, different, and modified judgment on the counts which have been affirmed and thereby augment the sentence originally imposed on such counts [1],[3].
 

 The appellate court's decision was based on the principle that once a case has been decided on appeal and remanded to the lower court, the lower court is bound by the decree as the law of the case and must carry it into execution according to the mandate. The lower court cannot vary it or examine it for any other purpose than execution. The appellate court's function is to affirm or reverse, and upon affirmance, the judgment appealed from remains only to be executed, and upon reversal, to be vacated [1].
 

 Therefore, the appellate court reversed the judgment of the District Court and remanded the case with directions that the judgment be vacated.

The court's opinion addressed several contentions raised by the appellant, Gene R. Austin, but ultimately found none of the arguments to be sound, thereby upholding the lower court's decision. The appellant's contentions included the argument that he was erroneously deprived of his rights by being permitted to defend himself without counsel, that he was wrongly convicted under the Dyer Act based solely on evidence of the sale of a stolen vehicle, that he should have been present when his motion to set aside the judgment was heard, and that the imposition of consecutive sentences for the transportation and sale of a stolen vehicle was improper. The appellate court referenced several other cases to support its decision to affirm the lower court's ruling [1].",1,0,0

William McCann, 65 U.S. 398 (1860) affirm or reverse the lower court's decision?",affirm,"In the Supreme Court case Lessee of Robert W. Smith and Carey W. Butt, Plaintiff in Error, v. William McCann, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision [1]. The case centered on the distinction between legal and equitable interests in property and whether a legal title that is held in trust, without the trustee having a beneficial interest, could be seized and sold under a fieri facias (fi.fa.) for the payment of debts.
 

 The Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Taney, held that the deed from Robert P. Brown to Richard D. Fenby conveyed only a naked legal interest to Fenby, which could not be levied on and sold under a fi.fa. issued on a judgment against him, as he had no beneficial interest therein. Consequently, the plaintiff, who sought to derive a legal title under this deed, could not recover in an action of ejectment because the evidence offered to prove that the trusts in the deed were fraudulent could not be used to enlarge or change the legal estate of the grantee against the plain words of the instrument [1].
 

 The Court further explained that if these trusts were indeed fraudulent, the lessors of the plaintiff had a clear and ample remedy in the court of chancery, which has exclusive jurisdiction over trusts and trust estates. The Court concluded that the instruction of the court below was correct, and the plaintiff could not recover in the action of ejectment [1].",1,0,0

City of New York, the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the lower court [1]. The case was decided on January 5, 1914, and it followed the precedent set by Adams Express Co. v. New York, which was decided on the same day [1]. The Supreme Court held that certain municipal ordinances of the City of New York were void and unconstitutional as applied to the interstate commerce of express companies [1]. The ordinances in question required express companies to obtain licenses for their wagons and drivers, which the Court found to be an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce [1]. The reversal meant that the United States Express Company was not subject to the licensing requirements imposed by the City of New York for its wagons and drivers engaged in interstate commerce [1].",1,0,0

Instead, the Supreme Court remanded the case back to the circuit court with specific instructions. The Supreme Court's decision was based on procedural grounds, noting that the prescribed period for filing a claim had not elapsed when the district court proceeded to decree a dismissal of the libel. The Supreme Court held that a claim could not be interposed for the first time in the Supreme Court, as it only has appellate jurisdiction in prize causes. Therefore, the Court directed that the cause be remanded to the circuit court to allow the claim to be filed there and also to allow the libel to be amended accordingly. This action was taken to enable the captors to obtain condemnation of the property if the asserted claim was not sustained and the property did not appear entitled to the protection of the Spanish treaty [1].",0,0,1

The state court had compelled a water company to furnish a connection at its own expense to a resident living on an ungraded street where the company had voluntarily laid its mains, even though it was not required to do so by its charter. The Supreme Court held that this did not impair the charter contract of the water company or deprive it of its property without due process of law. The decision was based on the interpretation that the obligations to make service connections and supply water were clearly settled by both statute law and decisions at the time the charter was granted, and thus the charter imposed the obligation to bear the cost of the service connection [1].",1,0,0

Robertson and Others*, 24 U.S. 332 (1826), the Supreme Court did not directly affirm or reverse the lower court's decision in the traditional sense of either upholding or overturning the entirety of the lower court's ruling. Instead, the case was brought before the Supreme Court due to a difference of opinion certified from the Circuit Court of Kentucky, which indicates a more nuanced approach to resolving the legal questions presented [1].
 

 The case involved complex issues regarding land grants, the effect of alienage on land ownership, and the interpretation of legislative acts in relation to land titles. The Supreme Court, through Mr. Justice Johnson, delivered an opinion that addressed these issues in detail, particularly focusing on the capacity of an alien to hold land granted by the government and the subsequent naturalization of the alien [1].
 

 The Supreme Court's analysis included a discussion on the principles of law applicable to the case, such as the effect of a grant to an alien and the impact of subsequent naturalization on such a grant. The Court examined historical and legal precedents to conclude that an alien could indeed hold land granted by the government until such title was challenged and revoked through an inquest of office or similar proceeding [1].
 

 Therefore, the Supreme Court's decision in this case was more about clarifying the legal principles and interpretations applicable to the facts, rather than a straightforward affirmation or reversal of the lower court's decision. The focus was on the legal capacity of aliens to hold land grants and the effect of naturalization, which were central issues in the dispute between the parties [1].",0,1,0

The Supreme Court's decision focused on procedural aspects, such as the admissibility of evidence and the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's verdict.

Mendez did not meet the eligibility requirements for student financial assistance programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The university system was held liable for $1,712,540 in student grant funds it had disbursed, which led to the appeal. The appellate court held that the Secretary has discretion to determine what state actions qualify as ""legal authorization"" for purposes of Title IV eligibility, thereby affirming the judgment and awarding costs in favor of the Secretary [1],[4].",1,0,0

The case involved a dispute over general average, a maritime principle requiring that the loss incurred from a voluntary sacrifice of part of the ship or cargo to save the whole during an emergency be shared among all parties with an interest in the voyage.
 

 The Supreme Court, through Mr. Justice Clifford, upheld the jury's verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, Fowler, for $12,071.73, and judgment was entered accordingly. The Court agreed with the lower court's instructions to the jury, which included the determination that the stranding of the ship was voluntary and for the common benefit, thus entitling the plaintiffs to recover their proportion of the damages and expenses as general average [2],[3].
 

 The Court also found no error in the record regarding the objections raised by the defendants, Rathbones, to the adjustment submitted by the average adjusters. The instructions given to the jury were in conformity with the stipulations of the average bond, and the Court concluded that the plaintiffs were entitled to their verdict for the amount stated in the average adjustment, with interest from its date [3],[5].

The appellate court found that the jury instructions on the question of employment were erroneous and not aligned with the proper legal standards. Specifically, the instructions given were abstract and potentially misleading, focusing on a broad and incorrect definition of ""employee"" that did not accurately reflect the intentions of the parties to the insurance contract or the legal standards applicable to the determination of an employment relationship. The court emphasized that the definitions of ""employee"" for purposes of workmen's compensation statutes and collective bargaining agreements do not determine the meaning of ""employee"" as used in a policy of insurance.

The case involved an appeal challenging an award of attorney's fees made to counsel for the plaintiffs in a school desegregation suit filed against the School Board of the City of Richmond, Virginia. The appellate court concluded that the finding by the District Court of ""obdurate obstinacy"" on the part of the defendant School Board was error and that the legal standards to be followed by the Richmond School Board in working out an acceptable plan of desegregation were not clear and plain at any time in 1970 or even 1971 [2],[3]. 
 

 The appellate court's decision was based on the view that the District Court's finding of obduracy was not supported by the evidence and that the School Board's conduct could not be fairly characterized as obdurate. The court noted that during the period for which attorney's fees were awarded, there was considerable uncertainty regarding the Board's obligations, and the School Board had been acting in anticipation of further rulings by the Supreme Court [2],[3].

The appellate court's decision to affirm was influenced by the complexity of the indictment counts and the jury's resolution thereof, which included acquittal on some counts and conviction on others. Despite Cohen's numerous appellate points, including arguments related to the division of a single offense into multiple offenses and potential jury confusion, the court found the jury's verdict to be supported by the evidence presented at trial.

This decision was based on the principle that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment precludes the government from relitigating any issue that was necessarily decided by a jury's acquittal in a prior trial.

The defendants raised two primary issues on appeal: whether the District Court improperly restricted defense counsel in the use of alleged Jencks Act statements during cross-examination of government witnesses, and whether the defendants were deprived of a fair trial due to comments from the bench, interruptions by the District Judge, and his examination of witnesses during the trial [2].
 

 The appellate court conducted a thorough examination of the trial transcript and evidence, scrutinizing the sufficiency of the evidence with an extra degree of care due to the first trial ending with a hung jury. The court found sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict of guilty [2].
 

 Regarding the Jencks Act question, the appellate court acknowledged the trial court's conclusion that the statements were within the scope of the Jencks Act, based on a government admission. The appellate court found no abuse of discretion or prejudice in the trial court's handling of the cross-examination and impeachment using these statements. The appellate court noted that the trial court provided a fair opportunity for cross-examination and impeachment, which did not constitute an abuse of discretion [2],[3].
 

 On the issue of comments, interruptions, and questioning of witnesses by the District Judge, the appellate court determined that even if some prejudice might have occurred at the time of the initial ruling by the District Court, the subsequent opportunity presented by the District Judge to recall and cross-examine witnesses after the ruling regarding the Jencks Act statements, in conjunction with the Court's instruction to the jury, was sufficient under the facts of the case [3].

The Supreme Court found that the plaintiffs, who were challenging the sale, had delayed their action to set aside the sale for too long after having full knowledge of the facts.

The appellant, Petro Chaboya, had sought to have his claim to a tract of land confirmed, but the Commissioners rejected the claim due to lack of evidence of a grant, possession, or cultivation. The District Court also rejected the claim, stating that it had no jurisdiction over the land in question as it had not been presented to the Board of Commissioners and it was too late to present the claim under the Act of 1851.
 

 Chaboya's main argument rested on his long-continued possession of the land. However, the Supreme Court found that Chaboya never had any legal title to the land beyond the five hundred acres allotted to him by the authorities of San Jose, which was confirmed by the District Court.

The court specifically addressed the scope of the temporary injunction, finding that the broader scope as entered by the District Court more effectively maintained the status quo than would an injunction of the more narrow scope urged by the respondents.

The appellate court agreed with the appellants, concluding that the elbow pipe was part of the machinery and its damage came under the exception, thereby relieving the appellants from liability for the breakage of machinery.

The Bank of the United States had claimed ten percent damages on the bill, which was drawn, accepted, and endorsed in Kentucky but was payable in New Orleans. The defendants, James Daniel et al., argued that they were not liable for the damages under Kentucky law and that the inclusion of the damages in the note was a mistake.
 

 The Supreme Court held that the bill of exchange was a foreign bill and not subject to Kentucky's statute that would have imposed ten percent damages. The Court also established that courts of equity will not relieve for mere mistakes of law, and that the statute of limitations barred the claim since the action to recover the alleged mistaken payment could have been brought much earlier [1].

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals found that the evidence presented by the government was insufficient to support a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. The court emphasized that a conviction could rest solely on circumstantial evidence, but in this case, the circumstantial evidence did not meet the necessary threshold. The appellate court's decision was based on the principle that a defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence bears a heavy burden, and a conviction should only be overturned if no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt [1],[2],[5]. 
 

 The appellate court specifically criticized the admission of lay opinion testimony regarding whether a small bulge in Parker's jacket was a handgun, which was deemed inadmissible under Federal Rules of Evidence 701(c) and 702. The court also found that the government's evidence of Parker's flight from the scene did not prove flight and, therefore, did not support an inference of consciousness of guilt. Additionally, the court concluded that Parker's false exculpatory statements to the police, while potentially indicative of consciousness of guilt, were not alone sufficient to prove guilt [2].

The defendants claimed that there had been a contract for conveyance of the land based on a proposition made by Lee in a letter, which they alleged had been accepted. The Supreme Court, however, found that the evidence did not support the existence of a contract. The Court concluded that the testimony of Kinney, who claimed to have written a letter accepting Lee's offer on behalf of himself and the Cogswells, was not sufficiently precise or corroborated by other evidence to establish the acceptance of the contract. The Court emphasized the lack of a written acceptance and the absence of any mention of such a contract in the settlement agreements made with Lee's administrator.

The appellate court's decision considered whether the defendant, Marra Bros., Inc., had a duty to Slattery as a ""business guest"" or ""invited person"" and whether the danger was open and apparent.

The appellate court found that the plaintiff's conduct did not constitute assumption of risk as a matter of law and that the condition of the machine could constitute a defective design for which there may be recovery under §402A.

Dewees, 67 U.S. 613 (1862), the Supreme Court did not simply affirm or reverse the lower court's decision in a straightforward manner. Instead, the Court's decision was nuanced, involving specific determinations regarding the rights and obligations of the parties involved based on the facts of the case and the application of legal principles.
 

 The Supreme Court, with Mr. Justice Miller delivering the opinion, addressed several key issues. One of the central points was the legal principle that when a party purchases property on behalf of another, the purchase is held in trust for the benefit of the principal upon repayment of the money advanced by the agent. This principle was applied in the context where two devisees or tenants in common hold under an imperfect title, and one of them buys in the outstanding title. The Court held that such a purchase would enure to their common benefit upon contribution made to repay the purchase-money [2].
 

 The case involved real estate that was the subject of controversy, held by the appellees (defendants in the Circuit Court) by inheritance from their father, William Dewees. The title to this property was challenged by the appellants (plaintiffs in the Circuit Court), who sought to have a deed set aside and to redeem the property from a tax sale. The Supreme Court's decision acknowledged the validity of the deed in Dewees' heirs unless the plaintiffs could redeem the sale and have the deed set aside for reasons stated in their bill [2].
 

 Ultimately, the Supreme Court's decision focused on the equitable principles governing the parties' rights to the property in question. The Court dismissed the petition of one of the appellants to be made a party and, on final hearing, dismissed the bill as to complainants Naylor and Smith. However, it decreed that Rothwell, in his purchase from Robert H. Smith (the assignee of John Reed), should be held to be a trustee for himself and wife, and the other defendants, heirs of Dewees. The defendants were ordered to make a contribution to Rothwell, in payment of the sum so paid by him to Smith, and for taxes afterward paid by him on the property [2].
 

 This decision reflects the Supreme Court's application of trust and equity principles rather than a straightforward affirmation or reversal of the lower court's decision. It demonstrates the Court's nuanced approach to resolving the specific legal and equitable issues presented by the case.",0,0,1

The sureties argued that they had signed the bond on the condition that it would not be delivered to the plaintiff, the United States, until it was also executed by another individual, Joseph Cloud, as a co-surety. However, this condition was not met, and the bond was delivered without Cloud's signature. The Supreme Court held that the sureties could not avoid their obligations under the bond due to the condition they placed on its delivery, especially since the United States had no notice of this condition and the bond was regular on its face. The Court's reasoning was based on principles of estoppel, emphasizing that a party cannot set up a condition unknown to the other party to avoid liability, especially when the other party has acted to its prejudice based on the belief that the bond was validly executed. The judgment of the lower court in favor of the United States, holding all parties to the bond liable for the amount owed by the principals, was therefore affirmed [1],[2].",1,0,0

The case involved the interpretation of an oil and gas lease and the appellate court found no ambiguity in the lease, determining that the production of oil in paying quantities from a single well was sufficient to hold the entire lease in effect after the expiration of the primary term. The court concluded that the provisions in question applied only to the primary term and were intended to assure the lessor of rental payments during that period, with a reduction instead of cessation in the event of production or drilling under the lease.

National Solid Wastes Management Ass'n, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court concluded that the Illinois licensing acts, which required certain training and experience for workers in hazardous waste operations, were pre-empted by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) to the extent that they established occupational safety and health standards for training those who work with hazardous wastes [7]. The Court held that the state laws were pre-empted because they constituted a direct, clear, and substantial regulation of worker health and safety, which is an area covered by federal OSHA standards [5],[7]. 
 

 The Court's decision was based on the understanding that the OSH Act pre-empts all state ""occupational safety and health standards relating to any occupational safety or health issue with respect to which a Federal standard has been promulgated,"" unless a state plan has been submitted and approved pursuant to 18(b) of the Act [10]. The Court reasoned that allowing states to supplement federal regulations without undergoing the 18(b) approval process would be inconsistent with the federal scheme of establishing uniform standards and could potentially lead to duplicative regulation [8],[9]. 
 

 Therefore, the Supreme Court's decision in Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Ass'n affirmed the lower court's ruling that the Illinois licensing acts were pre-empted by the OSH Act [7].",1,0,0

Detroit Railway, 171 U.S. 48 (1897), the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the decision of the lower court. The case involved a dispute over whether the city of Detroit had the authority to grant an exclusive privilege to the plaintiff, Detroit Citizens' Street Railway Company, to operate its railways in the city and whether the subsequent grant to the defendant, Detroit Railway, impaired the contract between the city and the plaintiff. The Supreme Court of Michigan had affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiff's suit, and the plaintiff then brought the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.
 

 The U.S. Supreme Court held that the common council of Detroit did not have the inherent power to confer the exclusive privilege claimed by the plaintiff. The Court also found that the statute under which the plaintiff's predecessor was organized did not confer such power on the municipality. The Court concluded that the power to grant an exclusive privilege must be given in explicit language or necessarily implied from other powers, which was not the case here. Therefore, the decree of the Supreme Court of Michigan was affirmed, meaning that the plaintiff's contention was rejected, and the lower court's decision to dismiss the case was upheld [1],[2].",1,0,0

The court found that the petitioner's allegations, even if proven, would not entitle him to relief. Specifically, the court noted that the petitioner had the opportunity to challenge the alleged perjured testimony during the trial but failed to do so. Additionally, the court referenced precedent indicating that the defense of entrapment cannot be raised in a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. 2255, aligning with the majority of courts' stance on this issue. The court also addressed the petitioner's contention regarding the appointment of counsel, concluding that there was no abuse of discretion by the district court in not appointing counsel for the petitioner in the proceedings before it.

The Merchants' Fire Insurance Company of Baltimore, 50 U.S. 390 (1850), the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Supreme Court's ruling was based on several key points, including the establishment of a contract through correspondence, the acceptance of terms proposed by the insurance company, and the subsequent responsibilities of the insurance company following the acceptance of these terms by Tayloe. The court found that a contract was indeed formed when Tayloe accepted the insurance terms proposed by the company and placed his acceptance letter in the mail. This contract was considered complete despite the insurance company's later refusal to acknowledge it after the insured property was destroyed by fire. The Supreme Court also addressed the issue of the insurance premium payment, determining that Tayloe's transmission of the check by mail, as directed by the insurance company's agent, constituted a valid payment of the premium. Furthermore, the court concluded that the insurance company's refusal to issue a policy and denial of responsibility constituted a waiver of the requirement for Tayloe to furnish preliminary proofs of loss within a reasonable time. As a result, the Supreme Court directed the lower court to take further proceedings consistent with its opinion, effectively siding with Tayloe and reversing the lower court's dismissal of his claim [5].",1,0,0

The appellant was under conviction and sentence by a court of the State for the offense of sodomy. The District Court had denied his application for a writ of habeas corpus, and the appellant appealed this decision. The appellate court affirmed the lower court's judgment, dismissing the application for habeas corpus. The court reasoned that the appellant was convicted with due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, despite his claim of being convicted without a public trial. The court noted that the appellant or his counsel did not object to the trial court's order to clear the courtroom during certain testimonies at the time, and the appellant took no appeal from the judgment of conviction to the Minnesota Supreme Court.

The defendants argued that the patents to Pratt and Bryan were void and an infringement upon certain patents granted to Springer and Lowe. They also claimed that the plaintiffs had not defended them against a suit for infringement as agreed in the contract. The Supreme Court of Illinois had affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court, which found in favor of the defendant, Paris Gas Light and Coke Company. The Supreme Court of the United States, in reviewing the case, focused on whether the state court had jurisdiction to consider the validity of the patents in question and concluded that it did. The Court held that the action was not one arising under the patent right laws of the United States in any proper sense of the term, as the plaintiff must set up some right, title, or interest under the patent laws, or at least make it appear that some right or privilege will be defeated by one construction, or sustained by the opposite construction of these laws.

The appellate court's decision was based on a careful review of the record, which supported the conclusion that Fred Thrasher had used all reasonable care in the operation of the vessel and was not aware of any condition that could have caused the explosion leading to Bryant Lee Capps' death. The court also concurred with the lower court's judgment regarding the application of the *res ipsa loquitur* doctrine, finding that even if this doctrine applied, the evidence absolved Thrasher of the imputation of negligence.

The court found no persuasive evidence that the arrest on December 23, 1989, for an immigration warrant, had any connection with the federal drug charges for which Orbino was later indicted.

This decision was based on the principle that there is no provision in the Constitution and laws of the United States for the return of parties who, by violence and without lawful authority, have been abducted from a State. The Court held that the laws of the United States do not recognize any right of asylum for a fugitive from justice in any State to which he has fled, nor have they made any provision for the return of parties abducted from a State.

The Court allowed the writ to be amended and a new citation to be issued to all plaintiffs below, set aside its previous judgment, and directed the cause to be restored to the docket for reargument.

This decision effectively reversed the lower court's decision in part, specifically regarding the due process claims related to the disciplinary proceedings against the plaintiff, Walter H. Dyson. The appellate court found that the use of an ""unidentifiable substance"" found in Dyson's feces as the foundation for a finding of guilt was arbitrary and a violation of Dyson's due process rights. If the charge had solely been having a ""red balloon as contraband,"" the generalized finding of ""guilty of misconduct as written"" would have met the minimum requirements of procedural due process.

The lower court had issued an order releasing the petitioner, Frederic Henry, on habeas corpus, which was challenged by the defendant, General Courtney H. Hodges. The appellate court's decision to reverse the order was based on the examination of two main issues: whether Henry was deprived of a ""thorough and impartial investigation"" preliminary to convening a ""general court martial,"" as afforded by the Seventieth Article of War, and whether the ""general court martial"" before which he was tried was improperly constituted under the Eighth Article of War because the ""law member"" was not an officer of the Judge Advocate General's Department. The district judge had sided with the relator on the first point and with the respondent on the second. However, the appellate court, without deciding whether the absence of a ""thorough and impartial investigation"" was a jurisdictional defect, concluded that when the accused has had the substance of the protection the statute intended, formal defects do not touch the jurisdiction of the court, leading to the reversal of the lower court's order [2].",1,0,0

The case involved appellants who were recipients of Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) and challenged the Texas welfare system's method of applying a percentage reduction factor to arrive at a reduced standard of need, which was lower for AFDC than for other assistance programs. The appellants argued that this method contravened the Social Security Act and violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment due to racial discrimination, as the system provided somewhat lower welfare benefits for AFDC recipients than for the aged, blind, or disabled in other categories.
 

 The Supreme Court held that the Texas scheme did not contravene the Social Security Act, which does not require the use of a computation procedure that maximizes individual eligibility for subsidiary benefits. The Court also found that the challenged system did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The decision to provide lower welfare benefits for AFDC recipients than for the aged and infirm in other categories was not deemed invidious or irrational, and there was no constitutional or statutory requirement that relief categories be treated exactly alike [2].

The Supreme Court held that the involuntary bankrupt, Arndstein, did not waive his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination by filing schedules of assets and liabilities under the direction of the bankruptcy court. The Court reasoned that the mere filing of these schedules did not amount to an admission of guilt or furnish clear proof of crime, and thus, Arndstein could claim his constitutional privilege to refuse to answer questions that might incriminate him. The Supreme Court's decision emphasized the broad construction of the Fifth Amendment in favor of the right it was intended to secure, stating that a person should not be compelled to give testimony which might tend to show that he himself had committed a crime. Consequently, the judgment of the lower court was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings in conformity with the Supreme Court's opinion [2].",1,0,0

The Supreme Court held that the United States had the capacity to sue for the purpose of setting aside such conveyances and that the authority of the United States to enforce the restraint lawfully created could not be impaired by any action without its consent. The conveyance by the allottee's heirs was found to be directly within the statutory prohibition, and therefore, the later conveyances under which the appellants claimed were invalidated.

The court specifically disagreed with the government's theory that Baker could be found guilty under the presumption of transportation by possession, stating that there was no evidence to suggest even the barest elements of either actual or constructive possession of the car by Baker.

The appellate court found that the indictment did indeed provide sufficient notice of the potential for an enhanced penalty because it specified the involvement of a particular quantity of cocaine, which was ""500 grams or more."" This phrase was considered sufficient to encompass all amounts over 500 grams, including the five kilograms that were the basis for Zerick's ten-year sentence.

The lower court had held that a national bank is a citizen of every state in which it maintains a branch. However, the Supreme Court disagreed, holding that for diversity jurisdiction purposes, a national bank is only considered a citizen of the state in which its main office, as set forth in its articles of association, is located.

The Supreme Court of Louisiana had affirmed the judgment of the District Court, which favored Lowry, but upon review, the Supreme Court of the United States found grounds to reverse this decision. The reversal was based on several legal grounds, including issues related to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of the United States for Louisiana to conduct the seizure and sale of the property in question, and the admissibility of evidence to contradict the record of citizenship of Hector McNeill, among others.

However, upon appeal, the Third Circuit Court concluded that the subject matter of the patent and the prior art relating to the device were obvious under 35 U.S.C. § 103. This section stipulates that a patent may not be obtained if the invention's differences from the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.

Marketing Displays, Inc.*, 532 U.S. 23 (2001), the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The core issue revolved around the trade dress protection for the product design of a traffic sign stand, specifically a dual-spring design mechanism that keeps temporary road signs upright in adverse wind conditions. Marketing Displays, Inc. (MDI) held expired utility patents for this dual-spring design and claimed that its sign stands were recognizable to buyers and users because the patented design was visible near the sign stand's base. After the patents expired, Traffix Devices, Inc. began marketing sign stands with a dual-spring mechanism copied from MDI's design, leading MDI to sue for trade dress infringement under the Trademark Act of 1946.
 

 The District Court initially granted summary judgment in favor of Traffix, holding that no reasonable trier of fact could determine that MDI had established secondary meaning in its alleged trade dress, and that there could be no trade dress protection for the design because it was functional. The Sixth Circuit reversed this decision, suggesting that the District Court committed legal error by focusing solely on the dual-spring design when evaluating MDI's trade dress and not considering other aspects that could distinguish MDI's product from others.
 

 However, the Supreme Court held that the dual-spring design is a functional feature for which there is no trade dress protection, thus barring MDI's claim. The Court emphasized that an expired utility patent is strong evidence that the features therein claimed are functional. Since the dual-spring design was the central advance claimed in the expired utility patents, MDI could not overcome the strong evidentiary inference of functionality based on the disclosure of the dual-spring design in the claims of the expired patents. The Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit's decision and remanded the case, underscoring that functionality had been established, and therefore, whether the design had acquired secondary meaning need not be considered [1].",1,0,0

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the absence of the narcotics themselves, which had been destroyed according to established procedures, did not prejudice the defendant's case to the extent that a reversal was warranted. The court considered the evidence presented by the government as sufficient, despite the lack of the actual narcotics, and concluded that the defendant was not put at a disadvantage due to their absence. The court's decision was influenced by the fact that the defense was able to conduct a thorough cross-examination of the government's expert witnesses, which in the court's view, put the government at a disadvantage with the jury. The court also referenced United States v. Pullings, which supported the position that the absence of the narcotics did not necessarily prejudice the defendant's case.

The appellate court disagreed with the lower court's dismissal, finding that the plaintiffs' complaint should not have been dismissed as it was conceivable that the plaintiffs could, upon trial, make a case that would entitle them to some form of relief.

Miller Company (TCM). The United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida had granted the Millers' motion to suppress evidence obtained via what was claimed to be a defective search warrant. The government appealed this suppression.
 

 The appellate court, in its decision, reversed the district court's grant of the appellees' suppression motion. The appellate court disagreed with the lower court's conclusion that the search warrant affidavit failed to establish probable cause that the property destroyed in the arson was used in an activity affecting interstate commerce, which was a necessary element for a federal crime under the arson statute. The appellate court found that the affidavit provided a sufficient factual basis to conclude that the property damaged in the arson was used in an activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce, thus establishing probable cause of a federal crime. Consequently, the appellate court held that the evidence obtained through the search warrant should not have been suppressed [3].
 

 This reversal indicates that the appellate court found the lower court's ruling on the suppression motion to be incorrect based on its interpretation of the facts and the law, particularly concerning the requirements for establishing probable cause for a federal arson offense and the applicability of the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.",1,0,0

The court determined that the replacement of worn tubes and other parts by El Dorado Foundry constituted repairs only, rather than a reconstruction or rebuilding of the patented pumps, thereby not infringing on the patent held by Fluid Packed Pump Co.

The Supreme Court held that the plan had not dismantled the dual system but had instead operated to burden students and their parents with a responsibility that Brown II placed squarely on the School Board. The Court emphasized that the burden was on the school board to provide a plan that promises realistically to work now, and a plan that at this late date fails to provide meaningful assurance of prompt and effective disestablishment of a dual system is intolerable.

The plaintiffs, McPherson Oil Company and Hot Springs Coal Company, along with others, filed a bill of complaint against Albert C. Miller, seeking to establish title and ownership in themselves to a coal mining lease and certain coal mining permits. They alleged that Miller was a constructive trustee who held the lease and permits as an agent and in trust for the plaintiffs.
 

 The district court entered a decree that provided conditions under which the plaintiffs could pay a certain sum to Miller to hold all the land involved in the coal permit and the mining lease in controversy. If the plaintiffs failed to pay the amount by a specified date, the title to the coal mining permits and lease would vest automatically in Miller. The plaintiffs later filed a motion to set aside the decree, but the court denied the motion and entered a final decree quieting the title of the defendant in and to the lease and permits.
 

 The plaintiffs appealed, but the appellate court affirmed the trial court's decree, concluding that the settlement agreement was arrived at in open court, the plaintiffs were fully informed concerning all the terms of this settlement, and attempted to carry it out.

 Appellate courts review the decisions of lower courts to determine if there were any legal errors that could have affected the outcome of the case. If the appellate court finds that the law was applied correctly and that there was no prejudicial error, it will typically affirm the lower court's decision. If the appellate court finds that there were errors that could have affected the outcome, it may reverse the decision, which could result in a remand for a new trial or other actions depending on the nature of the error and the case.

The court found that the district court did not err by excluding evidence concerning the amnesty provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, nor did it err in its instructions to the jury regarding the defendant's state of mind. The appellate court held that the evidence excluded could not have demonstrated Anton's state of mind and that the district court's instructions were in line with the precedent set in United States v.

The Supreme Court held that such state-law claims are indeed preempted when it comes to generic drugs, as federal law prohibits generic drug manufacturers from independently changing their drugs' labels. This decision underscored the principle that state laws that require a private party to violate federal law are preempted and, thus, without effect.

Livestock Marketing Association et al.*, 544 U.S. 550 (2005), the Supreme Court vacated and remanded the decision of the lower court, effectively reversing the Eighth Circuit's affirmation of the District Court's finding that the Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985 and its implementing Beef Promotion and Research Order unconstitutionally compelled respondents to subsidize speech to which they objected on First Amendment grounds [1]. The Supreme Court held that because the beef checkoff funds the Government's own speech, it is not susceptible to a First Amendment compelled-subsidy challenge. This decision was based on the understanding that compelled support of government speech is fundamentally different from compelled support of private speech, and that the government has broader leeway to require funding for its own speech activities [1].",1,0,0

Vandver*, 232 F.2d 398 (1956), the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the lower court [1]. The appellate court agreed with the district court's findings that the insured's failure to apply for a waiver of premiums was due to circumstances beyond his control, specifically highlighting the insured's lack of knowledge of his true condition, which was induced by the affirmative acts of Veterans' Administration doctors. This lack of knowledge was deemed a circumstance beyond the decedent's control, justifying the application for a premium waiver by his beneficiary to ensure the collection of the policy. The court's affirmation was based on the evidence presented and the legal standards applicable to the case, without finding any error in the district court's judgment [1].",1,0,0

Co.*, 18 F.2d 29 (1927), the appellate court, specifically the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, reversed the decisions of the lower courts and remanded the cases with directions for further proceedings. This reversal indicates that the appellate court found the lower courts' rulings to be incorrect in some manner and required further examination or a different judgment to be made in light of their findings [3].
 

 The case involved multiple appeals and cross-appeals from the District Court of the United States for the Eastern Division of the Northern District of Ohio and the Western Division of the Southern District of Ohio. The litigation centered around patent infringement suits by the Bassick Manufacturing Company against the Lyman Manufacturing Company and others. The decrees from the first three cases, where all parties appealed, and the plaintiff alone appealed in the other cases, were all subject to reversal or modification according to the appellate court's opinion [3].
 

 This decision is significant as it reflects the appellate court's role in reviewing the decisions of lower courts. When an appellate court reverses a lower court's decision, it often means that the appellate court has found an error in the lower court's interpretation of the law, application of the law to the facts, or both. The case being remanded indicates that further action is required by the lower court to resolve the matter in accordance with the appellate court's findings and directions.",1,0,0

The case involved a seaman who sued for damages for personal injuries caused by an assault upon him by his superior aboard ship. The Supreme Court held that such an assault was negligence of the employer within the meaning of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, actionable against the employer as made applicable by the Merchant Marine Act. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, which had affirmed a recovery by the seaman for injuries resulting from the assault, was therefore affirmed by the Supreme Court [1].",1,0,0

United States*, 536 U.S. 545 (2002), the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court. The case involved William Joseph Harris, who was indicted for distributing marijuana and for carrying a firearm ""in relation to"" a drug trafficking crime. Harris pleaded guilty to distributing marijuana but disputed the firearm charge. The District Court found that Harris had brandished a firearm and sentenced him to the mandatory minimum sentence of seven years' imprisonment for the violation of 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1)(A), which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals [1].
 

 The Supreme Court held that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1)(A) defines a single offense, in which brandishing and discharging are sentencing factors to be found by the judge, not offense elements to be found by the jury. The Court also reaffirmed the decision in *McMillan v. Pennsylvania*, which had previously held that facts increasing the mandatory minimum sentence for a crime, but not beyond the statutory maximum, could be determined by a judge and did not need to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury [3].
 

 Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and IV, concluding that the statute in question, 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), is constitutional and that basing a 2-year increase in the defendant's minimum sentence on a judicial finding of brandishing does not evade the Fifth and Sixth Amendments' requirements [3],[6]. The Court's decision thus maintained the distinction between elements of a crime and sentencing factors, allowing the latter to be determined by a judge at sentencing [5].

The appellate court determined that the District Court should not have attempted to dispose of the case on the motions for summary judgment and should have denied each of them, setting the case for trial on the merits [1]. The appellate court held that the question of whether the defendant's policy was in force on November 23, 1961, with respect to liability coverage as well as collision coverage, was a genuine issue of fact that warranted a trial [2].

The rental payments were initially held to be ""ordinary and necessary"" business expenses deductible under §162 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 by the district court.

 The Supreme Court, in this case, held that state courts do not have the authority to issue writs of habeas corpus for the release of prisoners held under federal authority, and that the federal Fugitive Slave Act was constitutional. The decision reinforced the primacy of federal law over state law in matters of federal jurisdiction and emphasized the importance of maintaining the supremacy of federal courts in cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States [1][2][3][4][5][6].
 

 This case is significant as it addressed the contentious issue of states' rights versus federal authority, a debate that was central to the political climate leading up to the American Civil War.

The Supreme Court held that a second application for removal was permissible if subsequent pleadings or conduct of the parties revealed that the cause was removable, and this right was not negated by a previous order to remand.

This case involved legal principles surrounding the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, specifically addressing issues related to preferences obtained through legal proceedings and the rights of landlords under state statutes in bankruptcy situations [1],[2],[3].
 

 The case centered on a dispute over the rights to proceeds from the sale of property seized under a distress warrant issued for unpaid rent. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, which had ruled in favor of the landlord, Mayer. The Court held that the general lien given by the laws of Georgia to the landlord on the property of the tenant existed from the time of the lease and was not obtained through legal proceedings within the meaning of the antipreference provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. Therefore, the lien was not voided by the bankruptcy proceedings [2].
 

 This case is significant for its interpretation of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, particularly in how it applies to liens and the rights of landlords versus the rights of other creditors in bankruptcy situations.

 The background of the case involves respondents suing the city of Riverside, its Chief of Police, and 30 individual police officers under various civil rights statutes for allegedly violating their First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The jury awarded the respondents a total of $33,350 in compensatory and punitive damages. Subsequently, the respondents sought attorney's fees and costs under 1988, requesting compensation for the hours expended by their attorneys and law clerks, totaling $245,456.25. The District Court awarded this amount in attorney's fees, and the award was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit [1].

The Supreme Court ultimately affirmed the Court of Appeals, holding that the judgment is affirmed, thereby establishing that attorney's fees awarded under 42 U.S.C. 1988 need not be proportionate to the amount of damages recovered by a prevailing plaintiff in a civil rights lawsuit [1],[8].",1,0,0

The case involved plaintiffs who were Michigan residents alleging injuries caused by Rezulin, a drug marketed and sold by Warner-Lambert Co. for the treatment of Type-2 diabetes. The core legal issue revolved around a conflict between federal law and Michigan's products liability regime, specifically regarding whether federal law preempts state common law claims that survive a state's legislative narrowing of common law liability through a fraud exception to that statutory limitation. The 2nd Circuit Court concluded that federal law does not preempt these state claims, vacating the District Court's grant of judgment on the pleadings and remanding the case for further proceedings [1].",1,0,0

U.S. Immigration & Naturalization Service*, 202 F.3d 704 (2000), is a real case that was decided in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. The case involved Samuel Appiah, a petitioner, against the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The decision was rendered on January 20, 2000, and it addressed issues related to the application of the stop-time rule under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) as amended by the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA) [1]. 
 

 The court considered whether the new stop-time rule, which affects an alien's eligibility for suspension of deportation by marking the end of the period of continuous physical presence in the United States when the alien is served a notice to appear, should apply to Appiah's pending deportation proceedings. Appiah contended that applying the stop-time rule to his case would have an impermissible retroactive effect and would violate his due process and equal protection rights under the Fifth Amendment [1].
 

 The court concluded that Congress clearly intended for the stop-time rule to apply to pending deportation proceedings and that the rule does not have a retroactive effect because it does not impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed. The court also found that Appiah's due process and equal protection claims failed because illegal aliens have no vested right in not being deported, and the challenged statutory provisions easily withstand rational basis review [1].
 

 Therefore, the petition for review was denied, and the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals was affirmed [1].",1,0,0

The references provided all pertain to the case of Union Nat. Bank of Kansas City, Mo. v. Neill, with a citation of 149 F. 711, decided on December 11, 1906, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit [1][2][3][4]. This case discusses the authority of partners in a trading partnership, the implications of signing firm names on negotiable instruments, and the rights of bona fide purchasers without notice of any infirmity in the notes they acquire.
 

 In Union Nat. Bank of Kansas City, Mo. v. Neill, the court explored the extent of a partner's authority to bind the firm through the execution of negotiable instruments and the protections afforded to innocent purchasers of such instruments. The case clarified that in a trading partnership, a partner has implied authority to engage in transactions that are within the scope of the partnership's business, including the borrowing of money and the issuance of negotiable instruments in the firm's name. However, this authority does not extend to acts that are outside the ordinary course of business, such as signing the firm name as an accommodation indorser without authorization [1].
 

 The court also addressed the situation where a partnership's name appears on a negotiable instrument alongside other signers, and whether this arrangement implies a contract of suretyship. It was determined that the mere order of signatures on a joint note does not create a presumption of suretyship, and that a partnership can be bound by a joint note even if it is not the sole maker. The court emphasized that the rights of bona fide purchasers for value are protected, provided they acquire the instrument without notice of any irregularity or infirmity [2][3][4].

The plaintiff alleged that his termination was due to his age, which he claimed violated Kentucky's Civil Rights Act, K.R.S. 344.040. The defendant contended that the plaintiff's lawsuit fell under the exclusive federal enforcement scheme contained in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), arguing that the plaintiff's desire to recover lost benefits converted his lawsuit into a federal cause of action governed by ERISA.

case_existence,"Is the case Estelle, Corrections Director v. Smith, 451 U.S. 454 (1980), a real case?",yes,"Yes, *Estelle, Corrections Director v. Smith*, 451 U.S. 454 (1981), is indeed a real legal case decided by the United States Supreme Court. The decision date was May 18, 1981, not 1980 as sometimes mistakenly referenced. This case involved significant constitutional issues, particularly concerning the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.
 

 The case arose after Ernest Benjamin Smith was indicted in Texas for murder, with the State announcing its intention to seek the death penalty. A psychiatric examination was ordered by the trial court to determine Smith's competency to stand trial. The examining psychiatrist, without advising Smith of his rights, concluded that Smith was competent. Later, during the sentencing phase of the trial, the psychiatrist testified over defense objections, stating that Smith would pose a future danger to society. This testimony played a crucial role in the jury's decision to impose the death penalty.
 

 The Supreme Court held that the admission of the psychiatrist's testimony at the penalty phase violated Smith's Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. The Court reasoned that Smith was not informed before the psychiatric examination that he had the right to remain silent and that any statements could be used against him at sentencing. This omission was deemed a constitutional error because the statements made during the examination were used to establish Smith's future dangerousness, a critical factor in the imposition of the death penalty.
 

 Furthermore, the Court found a violation of Smith's Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel. The defense was not notified that the psychiatric examination would address Smith's future dangerousness, depriving Smith of the opportunity to consult with his attorneys regarding whether to submit to the examination and how the findings could be used.
 

 This case underscores the importance of ensuring that defendants are fully informed of their rights and the potential use of their statements in capital sentencing proceedings. It also highlights the necessity of involving defense counsel in decisions related to psychiatric examinations that could impact the sentencing outcome [1].",1,0,0

The plaintiffs, Fowler, sought to recover from the defendants, Rathbones, as consignees and owners of cargo transported aboard the vessel, a sum alleged to be due by way of general average for losses and expenses incurred as a result of the stranding [1],[2],[3],[4],[5].
 

 The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, Fowler, holding that the stranding of the ship was voluntary and done to save the ship and cargo from greater expenses and peril, thus entitling the shipowners to recover their just proportion of such damages and expenses as general average [4],[5].

Marran, 376 F.3d 143 (2004), is indeed a real case that was decided in the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. The case involved appellants Rachel Marran and Claudia Librett against appellee Michael Marran, among others. The decision was filed on July 15, 2004, under docket number 03-3018, following arguments that took place on April 13, 2004. The jurisdiction for this case falls under the United States Court of Appeals, Third Circuit [1].
 

 The core of the dispute revolved around a protracted custody battle and allegations of child abuse. Claudia Librett and her daughter Rachel Marran initiated the action based on allegations made during the custody proceedings. They appealed the order of the District Court dismissing their complaint under several grounds, including the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, Younger abstention, and Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal, although on somewhat different grounds than those given by the District Court [1].
 

 This case is significant for its discussion on the applicability of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, Younger abstention, and the handling of allegations of child abuse within custody disputes. It also touches upon the responsibilities of county offices of children and youth in investigating such allegations.",1,0,0

The decision date was June 13, 1983, not 1982 as initially inquired. This case involved a dispute where the petitioner, an aerospace engineer employed at the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, a facility operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), made public statements highly critical of the Center. He was subsequently demoted on the grounds that his statements were false and misleading. The Federal Employee Appeals Authority upheld the demotion, but the Civil Service Commission's Appeals Review Board later found the demotion had violated his First Amendment rights, recommending his restoration to his former position with backpay. The petitioner filed an action against the respondent in an Alabama state court, seeking to recover damages for violation of his First Amendment rights, which was eventually taken to the Federal District Court and then to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held that because the petitioner's claims arose out of an employment relationship governed by comprehensive procedural and substantive provisions offering meaningful remedies against the United States, it would be inappropriate to supplement that regulatory scheme with a new nonstatutory damages remedy [1][3].",1,0,0

Metrophones Telecommunications, Inc., 550 U.S. 45 (2007), is a real case that was decided by the United States Supreme Court. The decision date for this case was April 17, 2007, which confirms the timeframe around 2006 that you mentioned [1]. 
 

 The case involved the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and its regulations under the Communications Act of 1934. The FCC had established rules requiring long-distance carriers to compensate payphone operators when callers used payphones to access the carriers' lines without depositing coins. The Supreme Court held that the FCC's application of section 201(b) to the carrier's refusal to pay compensation was lawful, and section 207 authorized a federal-court lawsuit by a payphone operator against a carrier that refused to pay the mandated compensation [1]. 
 

 Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court, with a majority of the justices joining. There were dissenting opinions filed by Justices Scalia and Thomas [1]. The case affirmed the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which had agreed with the District Court's determination that Global Crossing's refusal to pay violated section 201(b) of the Communications Act, thereby permitting Metrophones to sue under section 207 for the compensation owed [1].

The case was argued on November 17, 1892, and decided on December 5, 1892. It involved the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad Company as the plaintiff and Alsbrook as the defendant [1].
 

 The central issue in the case revolved around the exemption from state taxation of certain railroad properties. The Supreme Court held that a valid grant to a corporation by a state statute, which includes the right of exemption from state taxation given without reservation of the right of appeal, constitutes a contract between the state and the corporation. This contract is protected by the Constitution of the United States against state legislative impairment. However, the Court also emphasized that the surrender of the power of taxation by a state cannot be inferred or assumed in the presence of doubt. When the language used in the statute admits reasonable contention, the conclusion must favor the reservation of the power of taxation [1].
 

 Furthermore, the Court found that the exemption from taxation conferred upon the Wilmington Raleigh Railroad Company by the act of January 3, 1834, did not extend to branch roads that the company was authorized to construct. The exemption was specifically for the main road constructed under the charter, not for any additional branches or extensions [1].
 

 This case is significant as it clarifies the extent to which state-granted tax exemptions to corporations can be considered binding contracts under the U.S. Constitution, and it delineates the limitations of such exemptions, particularly in relation to corporate expansions or extensions beyond the original grant.",1,0,0

The Supreme Court's decision affirmed the judgment of the lower court, holding that the transfer of property was a conditional sale that had become absolute and was not a mortgage.

The case was decided on June 21, 1973, and involved a challenge to Georgia's obscenity laws. The plaintiffs, operators of the Paris Adult Theatre I and II, sought to prevent the state from enforcing obscenity laws against them for exhibiting films that were deemed obscene. The Supreme Court of Georgia had reversed a trial court's dismissal of the state's complaints, holding that the films were not protected under the First Amendment and their exhibition should have been enjoined [1].
 

 The Supreme Court of the United States, in its decision, held that obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment. This case is significant for its clarification of the standards for determining what constitutes obscene material and the state's power to regulate such material. The Court emphasized that while states have a legitimate interest in regulating obscene material, any restrictions must comply with the First Amendment. The decision also highlighted the procedural safeguards required when a state seeks to regulate the exhibition of allegedly obscene materials [1],[3],[8].
 

 This case, along with others decided during the same period, played a crucial role in shaping the legal landscape regarding obscenity, free speech, and the First Amendment.

The case involved intricate legal questions regarding land rights and the authority of trustees over town lands, specifically in the context of the town of Clarksville. The dispute centered around the rights and improvements made on a slip of land granted by the trustees of Clarksville to William Clark, which were then transferred to Fetter, Hughes, and Fuller. The plaintiffs, the trustees of the town of Clarksville, sought to eject Hughes from the land, leading to a legal battle that reached the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court, with Chief Justice John Marshall delivering the opinion, ultimately ruled in favor of the defendant, Gideon Davis, reversing the judgment of the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia [1]. 
 

 The case centered around the conduct of lottery managers and the drawing of the lottery, which had certain irregularities. The Court had to determine whether these irregularities vitiated the drawing of the lottery. The Supreme Court held that the irregularities did not vitiate the drawing, as the conduct of the managers was bona fide and the mistakes were unintentional and unimportant [1].

The case was decided on January 1, 1818, and it is documented under the citation 16 U.S. 172. This case involved a legal dispute where Dugan et al., acting as executors of Clarke, were the defendants, and the United States was the plaintiff [1],[2],[3]. 
 

 The core issue in this case revolved around the interpretation and enforcement of a bill of exchange. The Supreme Court, through its judgment, affirmed the decision that the United States, represented by its treasurer, had a legitimate interest in the bill of exchange that enabled it to sue in its own name. This was based on the understanding that the bill was purchased with the money of the United States, it was endorsed to their treasurer, registered at their treasury, and was intended for the government's use, thereby making the United States the real party interested in the bill's subject matter [2].
 

 The court also addressed the legal standing of the United States to sue on a bill of exchange, emphasizing that the United States, as a body politic and corporate, has the right to sue on a bill just like any other entity. This right is essential for the collection of public revenue, support of government, and payment of public debts. The court rejected the argument that the United States could not maintain the action because the bill was endorsed to Messrs. Willinks and Van Staphorst, stating that the United States could recover without producing a receipt or re-endorsement from them. The court reasoned that the mere act of returning the bill to the secretary of the treasury was sufficient to divest any title the last endorsees had in the bill, presuming they acted as agents or bankers of the United States [1],[2].
 

 This case is significant for its interpretation of the rights of the United States in the context of financial instruments and transactions, establishing that the government can sue in its own name on matters of financial interest, and that the return of a bill of exchange to the government's treasury can suffice to establish its interest in the bill, negating the need for formal re-endorsement or receipt from previous endorsees [1],[2],[3].",1,0,0

The case involved Burnis Asbell, Jr., who was charged with refusing to submit to induction into the armed services, a violation under 50 U.S.C. App. 462(a). Asbell's defense centered on the military authorities' failure to make a decision regarding his medical acceptability for induction, as required by 50 U.S.C.

case_existence,"Is the case Williams et al. v. Riley, State Controller of California, 280 U.S. 78 (1929), a real case?",yes,"Yes, the Supreme Court case *Williams et al. v. Riley, State Controller of California, 280 U.S. 78 (1929)* is indeed a real case and holds significance as a legal precedent. The case was decided on November 25, 1929, and involved statutes of California that directed all distributors of motor vehicle fuel to be licensed and pay taxes amounting to three cents per gallon sold, less an allowance of 1%, and provided for reimbursing purchasers of fuel not used for operating vehicles upon public highways. The plaintiffs, representing citizens and taxpayers of the State, sued the state officer charged with the duty of collecting the tax, alleging that the tax was in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, the Federal Highway Acts, and the constitution of the State. The Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs had no status to maintain such a suit, affirming the decree of the District Court dismissing the bill in a suit to enjoin the State Controller of California from enforcing statutes imposing a gasoline tax [1].
 

 This case is significant as it addresses the principles surrounding taxpayer standing, the application of state taxation in relation to federal law, and the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment in the context of state-imposed taxes. The decision in *Williams v. Riley* contributes to the body of law defining the limits of taxpayer standing and the interplay between state taxation powers and constitutional protections.",1,0,0

This case involved multiple plaintiffs who were residents of North Dakota, most of whom suffered their alleged injuries within the state's borders. The litigation centered around personal injury claims related to asbestos exposure. The court consolidated several cases into a master docket and addressed various legal issues, including personal jurisdiction over the defendant, Cassiar Mining Corporation, a Canadian entity. The court ultimately found that it had personal jurisdiction over Cassiar, rejecting the defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The decision was based on the assertion that Cassiar participated in a civil conspiracy to deceive the public about the dangers of asbestos, which had a direct impact on the plaintiffs in North Dakota [1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6].",1,0,0

Carrigan* is a real case that was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. The case citation is 564 U.S. 117, and it was decided on June 13, 2011 [1]. This case involved the Nevada Commission on Ethics initiating an investigation into Michael Carrigan, an elected member of the City Council of Sparks, Nevada. The investigation was in response to complaints that Carrigan had violated a recusal provision of the State's Ethics in Government Law by voting to approve an application for a hotel/casino project, despite having a conflict of interest due to his relationship with a consultant working for the project [1].
 

 The Nevada Supreme Court had invalidated the recusal provision, finding it unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First Amendment. However, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed the Nevada Supreme Court's decision. Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court, which considered whether legislators have a personal, First Amendment right to vote on any given matter. The Court concluded that the First Amendment does not prevent the enforcement of a recusal rule that restricts a legislator from voting on matters where there is a conflict of interest, thereby upholding the recusal provision of Nevada's Ethics in Government Law [1].",1,0,0

The case involved an appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and was presided over by Circuit Judges ADAMS, BECKER, and VAN DUSEN, with VAN DUSEN serving as the Senior Circuit Judge delivering the opinion of the court [1].
 

 The plaintiff, American Bearing Company, Inc. (""American""), initiated this action against Litton Industrial Products, Inc. (""Litton""), alleging product defamation, monopolization, and attempted monopolization based on the dissemination of an allegedly false Litton memorandum that evaluated an American product. The jury found Litton liable for monopolization and attempted monopolization in violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act but not for product defamation. The jury's award to American was subsequently trebled by the court. However, following post-trial motions, the district court set aside the jury verdict and ordered a new trial. At the end of the second trial, the district court granted defendant's motion for a directed verdict at the close of plaintiff's case on liability and entered judgment for the defendant [1].

The Supreme Court ultimately held that the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, which created a Federal Election Commission and established procedures for processing complaints of alleged violations, constituted an intervening law that required the reversal of the Court of Appeals' holding that had found a private cause of action [1].

The decision date was March 6, 2003, and it involved a dispute between Energex Enterprises, Inc., the plaintiff, and Anthony Doors, Inc., the defendant.

Energex claimed that Anthony Doors developed a similar product, the ""Optimiser,"" using confidential information and trade secrets disclosed under the agreement, thereby breaching the agreement and engaging in unfair competition, among other claims [1],[2].
 

 The court, presided over by Senior District Judge John L. Kane, addressed several legal issues, including the validity of the non-competition and non-disclosure clauses in the agreement between the parties. The court found no basis for applying C.R.S. 8-2-113(2) to the Agreement's non-competition clause at the time, indicating that the non-competition agreement between Energex and Anthony did not limit Anthony's ability to do business in a manner that would invoke the statute's application. Furthermore, the court rejected Anthony's contention that the non-competition agreement was void under Colorado statute, noting that the statute does not apply to contracts for the protection of trade secrets [2].

 The Supreme Court held that the grant of authority to the ICC under 49 U.S.C. 10505(f) encompasses the motor freight portion of a Plan II TOFC/COFC shipment entirely within the State of Texas. The Court found that since all of the elements of the Plan II service at issue were provided on equipment owned and operated by a rail carrier over which the ICC has jurisdiction, the plain language of 10505(f) unambiguously supported the ICC's position [2]. The decision reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which had held that the truck portion of the intrastate movements at issue was not ""transportation provided by a rail carrier"" within the meaning of 10505(f) but rather was ""transportation provided by a motor carrier"" within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 10521(b)(1), which reserves such intrastate transportation for state regulation [2].",1,0,0

Supp. 2d 1046 (2009)* is a real case that was decided in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona between 2008 and 2010. The case was presided over by District Judge Neil Wake and involved the plaintiff, David A. Richardson, alleging infringement by the defendant, The Stanley Works, Inc. (""Stanley""), of a design patent held by Richardson. The patent in question was for a carpentry tool named the ""Stepclaw,"" which combined a conventional hammer with a stud climbing tool and a crow-bar. The court's decision focused on the issues of patent infringement and the ornamental versus functional aspects of the design in question [1].
 

 The court analyzed the claim construction, distinguishing between the functional and ornamental elements of the design. It concluded that the overall configuration of the tool's elements was dictated by their functional purpose and therefore not protected by the design patent. However, the court recognized that the `167 patent did protect certain ornamental aspects of Richardson's design. Despite this, the court found no infringement by Stanley, noting substantial ornamental differences between Richardson's Stepclaw and Stanley's Fubar tool designs. The court's analysis was grounded in the principle that design patents protect the novel, ornamental features of a design, not its functional elements [1].
 

 This case illustrates the complexities involved in design patent infringement litigation, particularly the challenge of distinguishing between functional and ornamental aspects of a patented design. The decision underscores the importance of a detailed analysis of the patented design and the accused product to determine infringement, taking into consideration both the patent claims and the prior art in the field [1].",1,0,0

Mississippi Tax Comm'n*, was decided on June 2, 1975. It involved the United States as the plaintiff and the Tax Commission of Mississippi among the defendants. The case citation is 421 U.S. 599, and it was docketed under No. 74-548 [1][2][3][4]. 
 

 The core issue in the case revolved around a Mississippi Tax Commission regulation that required out-of-state liquor distillers and suppliers to collect from military installations within Mississippi, and remit to the Commission, a tax in the form of a wholesale markup on liquor sold to the installations. The Supreme Court held that viewing the markup as a sales tax, the legal incidence of the tax rests upon instrumentalities of the United States as the purchasers, and hence the markup was unconstitutional as a tax imposed upon the United States and its instrumentalities [4].

This case involved anti-trust prosecutions against Safeway Stores, Incorporated, and Kroger Grocery Baking Company, among others, under separate indictments alleging violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. The court's decision on defendants' demurrers was to sustain them, meaning the court found the indictments too general, vague, and indefinite to sufficiently inform the defendants of the accusations against them to prepare a defense.

The case involved two related actions brought by Powerscreen USA, LLC (""Powerscreen"") and Terex Corporation, the successor to BL-Pegson USA, Inc. (""Terex""), against D L Equipment, Inc. The litigation arose from the deterioration of a long-standing business relationship between Powerscreen and two distributors, D L Equipment, Inc. and S L Equipment, Inc. Powerscreen and Terex sought to recover on allegedly unpaid invoices for equipment and parts, while the distributors counterclaimed alleging various wrongs by Powerscreen, including breaches of warranty, and interference with their contracts and prospective business relationships [2].
 

 The court, presided over by Judge Charles R. Simpson III, issued several rulings on motions for summary judgment, addressing claims for unpaid invoices, breaches of warranty, and tortious interference, among others. For instance, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Powerscreen on its claims for unpaid invoices, finding no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the claims for recovery of the sums due on Powerscreen's unpaid invoices [5]. Additionally, the court addressed warranty claims, finding no genuine issue of material fact with respect to warranty claims made in 1999 and 2000, and that Powerscreen was entitled to summary judgment as to those claims [1].

The legal challenge was against the legality of the conviction and sentences, with the defendants arguing that the acts under which they were convicted had been superseded and repealed by the National Prohibition Act of October 28, 1919.

case_existence,"Is the case Amos Kendall, Plaintiff in Error, v. William B. Stokes, Lucius W. Stockton, and Daniel Moore, Survivors of Richard C.

Stockton, and Daniel Moore, Survivors of Richard C. Stockton, Defendants in Error, 44 U.S. 87 (1845)* is a real historical case. This case, often cited as *Kendall v. Stokes*, involved a dispute that reached the Supreme Court of the United States, where the primary legal issues revolved around the actions of Amos Kendall, the Postmaster General at the time, in relation to certain mail transportation contracts and subsequent financial settlements [1].
 

 The case was brought up by writ of error from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Columbia. It centered on Kendall's refusal to comply with a mandamus issued by the Circuit Court, which commanded him to settle claims and credit amounts as directed by an act of Congress and an award by the solicitor of the Treasury. The plaintiffs, William B. Stokes, Lucius W. Stockton, and Daniel Moore, argued that Kendall, in his capacity as Postmaster General, wrongfully suspended certain credits that had been previously allowed and entered into the books of the Post-office Department by his predecessor, leading to financial damages [1].
 

 The Supreme Court's decision in this case is significant for its examination of the duties and liabilities of public officers, particularly in situations where they are required to exercise judgment and discretion. The Court held that a public officer, acting from a sense of duty in a matter where he is required to exercise discretion, is not liable to an action for an error of judgment, even if an individual may suffer by his mistake. This principle was deemed crucial to prevent the potential for great mischiefs that could arise if public officers were held liable for such errors [1],[6].
 

 Furthermore, the case addressed the issue of double recovery and the choice of remedies, emphasizing that a party cannot be harassed twice for the same cause of action or proceed in another suit to recover damages for the same issue for which they have already obtained judgment [6].

The case involved the Capital City Dairy Company as the defendant and the state of Ohio as the plaintiff. The Supreme Court's decision addressed the legality of Ohio's statutes related to the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine within the state, particularly focusing on regulations that prohibited the addition of coloring matter to oleomargarine that would make it resemble butter. The Court upheld the Ohio statutes, finding them not to be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. The judgment was based on the consideration that the statutes were a reasonable exercise of the state's police powers, aimed at preventing fraud and protecting public health by regulating the sale of food products. The Court also noted that the Fifth Amendment operates solely on the National Government and not on the states, and that the statutes in question did not violate the commerce clause of the Constitution as they applied to activities within the state of Ohio [1].",1,0,0

Jeffrey Timothy Landrigan, aka Billy Patrick Wayne Hill*, 550 U.S. 465 (2007), is a real case that was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. The case was decided on May 14, 2007, and involved the respondent, Jeffrey Timothy Landrigan, who was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The central legal issue revolved around Landrigan's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during his sentencing phase, specifically his counsel's failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence. Landrigan had instructed his counsel not to present any mitigating evidence at his sentencing hearing, and he interrupted attempts to proffer other evidence, expressing a desire to receive the death penalty.
 

 The District Court refused to grant Landrigan an evidentiary hearing on his habeas petition, concluding he could not make out a colorable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel due to his own instructions not to present mitigating evidence. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision, but the Supreme Court held that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant an evidentiary hearing. The Supreme Court's decision emphasized the deferential standards of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) for granting federal habeas relief and concluded that Landrigan's actions during his trial and sentencing precluded him from demonstrating prejudice under Strickland v. Washington due to his counsel's performance [1].",1,0,0

The appellant, Archie Poulas, was convicted of transporting and concealing non-tax paid liquor, a violation of 26 U.S.C.A. 1287 and section 1441. The primary legal issue in the case revolved around whether evidence obtained by what was claimed to be an illegal search and seizure should have been admitted into evidence.

It involved a dispute over wages between the master of the schooner Del Norte, Herman Frenz, and the schooner's owner, Hume, along with insurance companies that insured the vessel. The core of the dispute revolved around the payment of wages to Frenz for a period exceeding five months following the stranding of the vessel on June 11, 1904. The insurance companies, having been notified of the stranding, sent an agent to the vessel to oversee rescue and repair efforts, during which the crew was discharged except for the master, Frenz. The case delved into whether Hume or the insurance companies were responsible for paying the wages Frenz claimed were due to him for his services during and after the rescue and repair of the schooner. The court ultimately dismissed the libel against the insurance companies and ruled in favor of Frenz against Hume, leading to an appeal by Hume.

The plaintiff in the case was Ignacio Gual Morales, and the defendant was Pedro Hernandez Vega, who was the Director of the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (P.R.A.S.A.) at the time of the events leading to the lawsuit [1].
 

 The case revolved around a civil rights action brought under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1985, where the plaintiff, an employee of P.R.A.S.A., claimed a violation of his First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association, as well as his Fifth Amendment rights to due process of law. The plaintiff alleged that he was dismissed from his employment for refusing to use his personal automobile for work-related duties, which he was unable to do due to it being withdrawn from the mileage authorization list by P.R.A.S.A. This refusal, according to the plaintiff, was in the context of broader disputes over mileage reimbursement rates for employees using personal vehicles for work [1].

United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609 (1984)* is a real case that was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in the early 1980s. The case was decided on July 3, 1984, and involved a conflict between a state's efforts to eliminate gender-based discrimination and the constitutional freedom of association asserted by members of a private organization, the United States Jaycees [1]. 
 

 The core issue in the case was whether the Minnesota Human Rights Act, which required the United States Jaycees to admit women as full voting members, violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the organization's members. The Supreme Court, in an opinion delivered by Justice Brennan, reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which had concluded that the Minnesota Human Rights Act violated the constitutional rights of the Jaycees' members. The Supreme Court held that the application of the Minnesota Human Rights Act to compel the Jaycees to accept women as regular members did not abridge either the male members' freedom of intimate association or their freedom of expressive association [1].
 

 The Court reasoned that the Minnesota Act served a compelling state interest in eradicating discrimination against its female citizens, which justified the impact that application of the statute to the Jaycees may have on the male members' associational freedoms. The Court found no basis in the record for concluding that the admission of women as full voting members would impede the organization's ability to engage in its protected activities or to disseminate its preferred views [1].

 The Supreme Court held that the insurance proceeds the petitioner, Joseph C. Russello, received as a result of his arson activities constituted an ""interest"" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 1963(a)(1) and were therefore subject to forfeiture [4]. The Court reasoned that the term ""interest"" as used in the RICO statute was meant to be interpreted broadly to include profits and proceeds from racketeering activities [2].

The case was decided on December 5, 1972, and involved a statutory three-judge district court. The plaintiffs in the case were Maria Theresa Miranda and Marion A.

Shofstall as the Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction, Anita Lohr as the Pima County, Arizona Superintendent of Schools, Tucson School District No. 1, and John Posegate as the Chairman of the Arizona State Personnel Commission [1].
 

 The case centered around the plaintiffs' contention that certain Arizona laws, specifically Article 18, Section 10 of the Constitution of Arizona and Arizona Revised Statutes, Section 38-201, subsection B, as they were applied to them, contravened the United States Constitution. They argued that the actions taken under these laws by the defendants deprived them of their rights and immunities under the Equal Protection and Supremacy Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. Both Maria Theresa Miranda and Marion A. Huxtable sought employment in positions that were denied to them on the basis of their non-citizen status, which they argued was discriminatory and unconstitutional [1].
 

 The court concluded that the enforcement of the challenged laws by the defendants as aforesaid did indeed deprive Maria and Marion of their respective rights and immunities under the Equal Protection Clause and further contravened the Supremacy Clause. As a result, the court granted the motions for summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring the orders of discharge and rejection of employment null and void, and enjoined the defendants from enforcing the challenged statutes and regulations against the plaintiffs on the sole ground of their existing alienage [1].",1,0,0

Minnesota Public Interest Research Group et al., 468 U.S. 841 (1983), is a real case that was decided by the United States Supreme Court. The case addressed the constitutionality of a provision in the Military Selective Service Act that denied federal financial assistance under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to male students between the ages of 18 and 26 who failed to register for the draft [3].
 

 The Supreme Court held that Section 12(f) of the Military Selective Service Act was not a bill of attainder and did not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. The Court found that the statute did not single out nonregistrants based on their past conduct, as it allowed for late registration, and did not inflict punishment within the meaning of the Bill of Attainder Clause. Furthermore, the Court determined that the statute furthered nonpunitive legislative goals, such as encouraging registration and fairly allocating federal resources [3].
 

 The decision was delivered by Chief Justice Burger, with the majority opinion concluding that conditioning receipt of Title IV aid on draft registration was a rational means to improve compliance with the registration requirements and promote a fair allocation of scarce federal resources [4]. The Court also found that the statute did not compel students to incriminate themselves, as they were not under any compulsion to seek Title IV aid and thus had no reason to make any statement regarding their registration status [3].
 

 Dissenting opinions were filed by Justices Brennan and Marshall, who argued that the statute compelled self-incrimination and violated the right to equal protection under the Fifth Amendment [5],[7].",1,0,0

The Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether this Act applied to actions pending on the effective date of the amendment, concluding that when a law conferring jurisdiction is repealed without any reservation of jurisdiction over pending cases, all pending cases fall with the law [1],[2].",1,0,0
case_existence,"Is the case Starr International Co. v. United States, 856 F.3d 953 (2017), a real case?",yes,"Yes, the case **Starr International Co. v. United States, 856 F.3d 953 (2017)**, is a real case that was decided in the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals within the specified timeframe of 2016 to 2018. This case involved Starr International Company, Inc., acting on its own behalf and on behalf of two classes of similarly situated individuals, as the plaintiff-appellant, and the United States, along with American International Group, Inc. (AIG), as the defendant-cross-appellant [1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10]. 
 

 The case centered around the government's acquisition of AIG equity and subsequent actions relating to a reverse stock split during the 2008 financial crisis. Starr International contended that the government's acquisition of AIG equity constituted an illegal exaction in violation of Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, but sought relief for both this adjudged illegal exaction and for claims related to the reverse-stock-split [10]. 
 

 The U.S. Court of Federal Claims held a trial on Starr's direct claims, where Starr sought over $20 billion in relief on behalf of itself and other shareholders. The Claims Court ultimately held that the government's acquisition of AIG equity was an illegal exaction but declined to grant relief for either that adjudged illegal exaction or for Starr's reverse-stock-split claims. Starr appealed the denial of direct relief for its claims, while the government cross-appealed, arguing that Starr lacks standing to pursue its equity-acquisition claims directly or, alternatively, that the government's acquisition of equity did not constitute an illegal exaction [10].
 

 The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that Starr and the shareholders represented by Starr lacked standing to pursue the equity-acquisition claims directly, as those claims belong exclusively to AIG. Because this determination disposed of the equity-acquisition claims, the other issues regarding the merits of those claims were rendered moot. The court also concluded that the Claims Court did not err in denying relief for Starr's reverse-stock-split claims. Therefore, the court vacated the Claims Court's judgment that the government committed an illegal exaction and remanded with instructions to dismiss the equity-acquisition claims that seek direct relief. The judgment as to the denial of direct relief for the reverse-stock-split claims was affirmed [10].",1,0,0

Supp. 537 (1984), is indeed a real case that was heard in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. The case was decided on February 16, 1984, and involved the plaintiff, Chet Howard Learned, who brought the action against the defendants for declaratory and injunctive relief related to alleged irregularities in a tribal election process [1]. The court, presided over by District Judge David L. Russell, addressed several motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, particularly focusing on whether federal courts have jurisdiction over disputes arising from tribal elections under the Indian Civil Rights Act (ICRA) and other federal statutes [1].
 

 The court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claims presented by Learned. The decision emphasized that the jurisdiction of federal courts is conferred only by statutory enactment by Congress and that actions arising under the laws of other nations or quasi-sovereign entities, like Indian tribes, do not automatically confer jurisdiction to federal courts unless explicitly authorized by Congress [1]. The court also referenced the Supreme Court decision in *Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez*, which clarified the limited scope of federal jurisdiction over tribal matters under the ICRA, reinforcing the principle of tribal sovereignty and the autonomy of tribal legal systems [1].
 

 This case is significant in understanding the complexities of federal jurisdiction over tribal matters and the balance between respecting tribal sovereignty and providing a forum for the resolution of disputes involving tribal members.",1,0,0

The case involved the appellant Michael Anthony Adams and addressed the issue of whether the appellant was entitled to resentencing because the District Court failed to observe the requirement of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(c)(3)(C). This rule mandates that the District Court personally address the defendant before imposing sentence to determine whether the defendant wishes to make a statement or present any information in mitigation of the sentence [1][2][3][4][6][7][10].

The case involved Harry Novak, the plaintiff, who challenged the final determination of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Patricia Harris, the defendant, regarding the denial of retroactive payment of Social Security widower's insurance benefits [1][2][3].

The case involved Frank Finley, the appellant, seeking a writ of mandamus to compel a former attorney, Elinor Chandler, the appellee, to deliver a transcript of testimony.

The court ultimately found that it lacked jurisdiction over the case because the complaint asserted only a claim under state law, specifically challenging the court's jurisdiction under the Railway Labor Act and the Milwaukee Railroad Restructuring Act.

 The Supreme Court's decision on June 11, 2007, reversed and remanded a ruling from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Eighth Circuit had affirmed the removal of the case to Federal District Court under the federal officer removal statute, which allows for the removal of an action against any person acting under a federal officer or agency. The Supreme Court held that the fact a federal agency directs, supervises, and monitors a company in considerable detail does not bring that company within the scope of the federal officer removal statute, thereby permitting removal [3].
 

 This ruling is significant as it clarifies the scope of the federal officer removal statute and the conditions under which a private firm's compliance with federal laws, rules, and regulations does not by itself fall within the statute's phrase ""acting under"" a federal official. The decision underscores the distinction between regulatory compliance and acting under the direction and control of a federal officer or agency, with implications for the jurisdiction and removal of similar cases in the future.",1,0,0

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over federal cases originating in the states of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The decision was rendered on March 20, 2013, and involved an appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas [1]. 
 

 In this case, Francis Barker, Jr., the plaintiff-appellant, filed suit against Hercules Offshore, Inc. and other defendants after witnessing the death of his friend and co-worker in an accident on a jack-up rig attached to the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Barker sought relief under general maritime law, the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), and Texas tort law. The district court denied Barker's motion for remand and granted summary judgment to the defendants, which Barker then appealed [1].
 

 The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's decisions, holding that the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) provided federal subject matter jurisdiction over the action and that removal was proper under 28 U.S.C. 1441(a). The court also found that maritime law did not supplant the grant of federal question jurisdiction under OCSLA, and therefore the action was removable without regard to the citizenship or residence of the parties under 28 U.S.C. 1441(b) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10].
 

 The court's analysis included a discussion on the applicability of OCSLA, the proper jurisdiction under the Act, and the interplay between federal and maritime law in the context of the case.

This decision is significant as it pertains to antitrust litigation, specifically addressing issues of monopolization and attempted monopolization under section 2 of the Sherman Act. The case involved allegations that Litton Industries, Inc. disseminated false information about American Bearing Company's product, which American Bearing argued constituted product defamation and violated antitrust laws by monopolizing the market for slide bearings used in industrial applications.
 

 The Third Circuit's decision affirmed the district court's order for a new trial after a jury initially found Litton liable for monopolization and attempted monopolization, awarding damages to American Bearing, which the district court then trebled. The appellate court's affirmation was based on the conclusion that the district court correctly granted a new trial to prevent injustice and because the verdict was against the weight of the evidence presented, particularly concerning the relevant product market and causation in fact [5].
 

 This case illustrates the complexities involved in antitrust litigation, especially regarding the requirements for proving monopolization under the Sherman Act. It underscores the importance of defining the relevant market and demonstrating actual harm to competition, which are critical elements in such cases.

court_id,"Which court decided the case Roberts, Acting Commissioner, Minnesota Department of Human Rights, et al. v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609 (1983)?",Supreme Court,"The U.S. Supreme Court decided the case *Roberts, Acting Commissioner, Minnesota Department of Human Rights, et al. v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609* in 1984. This landmark decision addressed a conflict between a state's efforts to eliminate gender-based discrimination and the constitutional freedom of association asserted by members of a private organization, the United States Jaycees [1].
 

 The case originated when the United States Jaycees, a nonprofit membership corporation, challenged the Minnesota Human Rights Act's application to its membership policies. The organization had restricted full membership to young men, excluding women and older men from voting or holding office. The Minnesota Department of Human Rights found this practice to be in violation of the state's Human Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on sex in places of public accommodation [1].
 

 The Supreme Court, in a decision delivered by Justice Brennan, reversed the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit's decision. The Supreme Court held that the Minnesota Human Rights Act's application to the Jaycees did not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the organization's members. The Court reasoned that the state's interest in eradicating gender discrimination was sufficiently compelling to justify the impact on the Jaycees' associative rights. The Court found that the Jaycees' exclusion of women from full membership was not protected by the First Amendment's freedom of association because the organization was not sufficiently private or intimate to warrant such protection. Furthermore, the Court determined that allowing women to become full members would not impede the organization's ability to advocate public or private viewpoints [1].
 

 This decision is significant for its interpretation of the balance between state anti-discrimination laws and the constitutional rights of private organizations. It underscores the principle that efforts to combat discrimination can justify certain limitations on associative freedoms when the organization in question serves a public or quasi-public function and when the state's interests are compelling [1].",1,0,0

The case centered on the interpretation of the act of Congress of March 3, 1835, which prohibited the allowance of any per cent or additional pay, extra allowance, or compensation, on account of disbursing any public money, unless authorized by law. The Supreme Court's decision in this case is significant as it clarifies the application of the 1835 act and the limitations on claims for commissions or additional compensation by officers of the army in the performance of their duties related to the disbursement of public funds [1],[2].",1,0,0

The court ultimately concluded that no reasonable jury could conclude Pfizer's proffered reason for terminating Wagoner was pretextual, thus summary judgment in Pfizer's favor on Wagoner's age discrimination claim was appropriate.

This case was decided by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and involved the Michigan Building and Construction Trades Council challenging an act signed into law by Governor Richard Snyder.
 

 The discrepancy in the case title and citation suggests that the specific details of ""Grant v. Snyder"" with the citation 846 F. Supp. 2d 345 are not available within the provided references. Therefore, while the citation format is consistent with a real case, I cannot confirm the details of ""Grant v. Snyder"" without the appropriate reference.

However, the volume number ""32 U.S."" would date back to the early 19th century, which is inconsistent with the existence of The Boston Beer Company, Inc., a company founded in the late 20th century.
 

 Additionally, the reference cases provided do not include a case with the citation 32 U.S. 641 or a case involving Massachusetts v. The Boston Beer Company, Inc.

National Labor Relations Board, 99 U.S. 196, does not correspond to a real Supreme Court case. The citation format appears to be a combination of a U.S. Supreme Court citation and a volume number that would not match the Supreme Court's reporter. Supreme Court decisions are reported in the United States Reports (U.S.), and the volume number 99 would date back to the 19th century, which is inconsistent with the existence of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) as it was established in 1935.
 

 Moreover, the references provided do not include a case with the title Hughes v. National Labor Relations Board. The cases cited involve other parties and different legal issues related to the NLRB, such as National Woodwork Manufacturers Ass'n v. Nat'l Labor Relations Bd.

The confusion may arise from the nature of the case and its complexities, but it's important to clarify that Justice Harlan was the author of the majority opinion, not a dissent.
 

 The case involved a dispute over the liability of a deceased individual's estate for a claim against it, and whether certain transactions involving stock were made in good faith or to defraud creditors. Justice Harlan, in delivering the court's opinion, discussed at length the legal principles governing the issuance of stock at less than its face value, the liability of stockholders for corporate debts, and the jurisdiction of federal courts over such matters. The court held that the estate of the deceased was not liable for the face value of the stock by reason of specific statutes, and that the federal courts had jurisdiction over the case. The opinion also reaffirmed the principle that the capital stock of a corporation, especially its unpaid subscriptions, is a trust fund sub modo for the benefit of its general creditors [1].

The Court's rationale was grounded in the principle that the plaintiff had not established his right to the relief sought in equity, as he had not pursued or exhausted his legal remedies, which were deemed plain, adequate, and complete [1],[2],[3].
 

 The decision elaborated on the jurisdiction of courts in equity and nuisance cases, emphasizing that equity jurisdiction is concurrent with legal jurisdiction in cases of private nuisance but is subject to limitations. Specifically, the Court noted that equity would not intervene where a legal remedy is sufficient to address the grievance. Furthermore, the decision underscored the importance of establishing a clear right and a palpable violation thereof before seeking an injunction in equity, highlighting that the extraordinary remedy of an injunction would be withheld in cases where the evidence is conflicting or the injury doubtful [2],[3].
 

 Justice Swayne's opinion, as part of the unanimous decision, focused on the procedural and jurisdictional aspects of the case, particularly the appellant's failure to establish a right to relief in equity without first pursuing legal remedies. The opinion did not dissent from the Court's ultimate conclusion but rather contributed to the legal reasoning that led to the affirmation of the lower court's decision to dismiss the bill [1].
 

 In summary, Justice Noah Swayne did not provide a dissenting opinion in Parker v. Winnipiseogee Lake Cotton and Woollen Company. Instead, his contributions were part of the Court's unanimous decision that emphasized the necessity of pursuing legal remedies before seeking equitable relief in cases of private nuisance.",1,0,0

Massachusetts*, 543 U.S. 462 (2005), Justice Antonin Scalia did not author a dissenting opinion. The confusion may arise from the fact that Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court, which was in favor of the petitioner, Melvin Smith. The Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment forbade the judge from reconsidering a midtrial acquittal on the firearm count after the defense had rested its case [1].
 

 The core issue revolved around whether the Double Jeopardy Clause prevented the trial judge from revisiting an earlier decision to acquit the defendant of a specific charge, in this instance, unlawful possession of a firearm with a barrel length of less than 16 inches. The trial judge initially acquitted Smith of the firearm charge due to insufficient evidence but later reversed this decision before the case was submitted to the jury, based on additional legal arguments from the prosecution. The Supreme Court found that this action violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because it subjected the petitioner to a second ""factfinding proceeding going to guilt or innocence"" after an acquittal had been granted [1].
 

 Justice Scalia's opinion emphasized that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects against multiple prosecutions for the same offense and that once a defendant is acquitted, they should not be subjected to further proceedings on that charge. The opinion clarified that while states may have procedures for reconsidering midtrial determinations of insufficiency of evidence, Massachusetts did not have such a procedure at the time of Smith's trial. Therefore, the trial judge's action to reconsider the acquittal was not permissible under the Double Jeopardy Clause [1].
 

 In summary, Justice Scalia did not dissent in this case; rather, he authored the majority opinion that sided with the petitioner, Melvin Smith, finding a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause due to the trial judge's reconsideration of a midtrial acquittal.",1,0,0

Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","In the case of *Alden v. Providence Hospital*, 382 F.2d 163 (1967), there appears to be a misunderstanding in your query. The dissenting opinion you're asking about was not authored by Judge Garland, as Merrick Garland was not a judge at the time of this decision. Instead, the dissenting opinion in this case was provided by Circuit Judge Burger [2].
 

 Judge Burger's dissent focused on several key points regarding the relationship between hospitals, their staff, and patients. He argued that the majority misinterpreted the record and misunderstood the roles of physicians and hospitals in their relationships with patients. Judge Burger emphasized that hospitals, as custodial institutions providing specialized services, should not be equated with the duties of private attending physicians. He highlighted that hospitals are liable for the negligence of their agents in performing specialized services or failing to carry out the instructions of the patient's private physician, but they do not assume the role of diagnosing or treating patients except under the orders of a private physician [2].
 

 Judge Burger also pointed out that the evidence did not show that the hospital assumed any responsibility for the diagnosis and treatment of the appellant, Vincent A. Alden. He noted that Alden was referred to the hospital by a physician not employed by the hospital and that the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, not the hospital, controlled Alden's hospitalization and assigned him doctors. Judge Burger criticized the majority for failing to recognize these distinctions and for holding the hospital responsible for acts and omissions that were clearly the responsibility of the attending physicians, not the hospital [2].
 

 In summary, Judge Burger's dissent in *Alden v. Providence Hospital* argued against the majority's decision to reverse the directed verdict for the hospital and Dr. Bacchus, emphasizing the distinct roles and responsibilities of hospitals and physicians in patient care. He believed that the evidence did not support a finding of negligence on the part of the hospital or its resident physician, Dr. Bacchus, and that the majority's decision ignored the realities of hospital operations and the clear distinctions between hospital and physician functions [2].",0,1,0

Marvel Entertainment Group, a Division of Cadence Industries Corp., 493 U.S. 120 (1989), Justice Antonin Scalia did not write a dissenting opinion. In fact, Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court, which was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Brennan, White, Blackmun, Stevens, O'Connor, and Kennedy [1]. The case centered around the interpretation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, specifically whether sanctions under Rule 11 could be imposed not only against the individual attorney who signed a pleading but also against the law firm on whose behalf the attorney signed. The Supreme Court held that sanctions could only be imposed against the individual attorney who signed the document, not the law firm, interpreting ""the person who signed"" in Rule 11 to refer strictly to the individual attorney [1].
 

 Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote the dissenting opinion in this case, arguing that the Court's interpretation of Rule 11 was overly restrictive and undermined the discretion of federal trial judges to manage cases and police abusive litigation practices effectively. Justice Marshall believed that allowing sanctions against law firms, in addition to individual attorneys, would better serve the purposes of Rule 11 by encouraging internal monitoring within firms to prevent violations [3].
 

 Therefore, there was no dissenting opinion by Justice Scalia in Pavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Entertainment Group; he authored the majority opinion. The dissent was provided by Justice Marshall, who expressed concerns about limiting the ability of trial judges to impose sanctions on law firms for violations of Rule 11.",1,0,0

Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","In the case of *Carbonell v. People of Porto Rico*, 27 F.2d 253 (1928), the dissenting opinion by Judge Hicks is not directly available in the provided references. The main opinion, authored by Circuit Judge Anderson, focused on the issue of double jeopardy in relation to the defendant, Victor A. Carbonell, who was indicted and tried for the murder of Alfredo Martinez. After an initial conviction for manslaughter, a subsequent trial also resulted in a manslaughter conviction, raising questions about double jeopardy protections under the Porto Rican Organic Act [1].
 

 The majority opinion rejected the argument that the defendant's first conviction for manslaughter acted as an acquittal for the murder charge, thereby barring further prosecution for murder. This stance was supported by referencing decisions from the United States Supreme Court and other jurisdictions that have addressed similar interpretations of double jeopardy provisions. The court also dismissed the contention that Congress, through the Organic Act, had implicitly adopted a different interpretation of the double jeopardy clause that would align with the defendant's arguments [1].
 

 Given the absence of specific details about Judge Hicks' dissenting opinion in the provided references, it's not possible to directly address the arguments made in that dissent. Dissenting opinions often provide a contrasting interpretation of the law or the facts of the case, potentially offering alternative legal reasoning or highlighting concerns with the majority's approach.

Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","Justice Robert Jackson's dissent in the case of *Dickinson v. Petroleum Conversion Corp.* focused on the issue of finality of decrees and the right to appeal. He expressed concern over the practical implications of the majority's decision on the rights of litigants, particularly the creditors of the Petroleum Conversion Corporation. Jackson argued that the Court of Appeals should have been free to review the 1948 decree without regard to the appealability of the 1947 decree, criticizing the legal uncertainty surrounding what constitutes a ""final"" decree for the purposes of appeal [2].
 

 Jackson highlighted the difficulties faced by litigants who are penalized for failing to correctly anticipate an appellate court's determination of finality. He pointed out that neither statutes nor court opinions had provided a clear guide for determining finality, which had led to litigants being unfairly thrown out of court [2].
 

 In his dissent, Jackson also questioned the majority's application of the ""finality"" rule, which he believed attached undue consequences to the understandable failure of parties to appeal from the 1947 decree. He noted that the trial judge considered the 1947 decree interlocutory and non-appealable, and only the 1948 decree was declared ""final"" by the trial judge. Jackson argued that the creditors should not be deprived of an opportunity to appeal from the 1948 decree due to the corporation's failure to appeal from the earlier decree, which the trial judge himself seemed to have considered interlocutory [2].
 

 Furthermore, Jackson expressed skepticism about the distinctions made by the majority between the finality of the decrees as it applied to Dickinson versus Petroleum, arguing that such distinctions were unsubstantial. He emphasized that Petroleum, having litigated its claims and being bound by the judgment, was just as much a party as Dickinson, regardless of its status as an intervenor [4].
 

 In summary, Justice Jackson's dissenting opinion in *Dickinson v. Petroleum Conversion Corp.* raised significant concerns about the implications of the majority's decision on the rights of litigants to appeal and the practical challenges posed by the lack of clarity in determining the finality of decrees.",0,1,0

He believed that the plaintiffs' prior consent made it immaterial what price the defendant got for his share of the land and that he was under no obligation to disclose the price to the plaintiffs or to seek their consent again. Justice Woods criticized the trial court's charge for withdrawing from the jury all evidence showing the plaintiffs' antecedent assent to the sale and for instructing the jury that only the plaintiffs' subsequent assent could be effective.

Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","In the Supreme Court case *Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson*, 525 U.S. 432 (1999), Justice Clarence Thomas did not write a dissenting opinion. In fact, Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court, which was unanimous. This means that all Justices agreed with the decision and reasoning as articulated by Justice Thomas in the case [1].
 

 The core issue in *Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson* revolved around the amendments to a defined benefit plan managed by Hughes Aircraft Company, which were challenged under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The plaintiffs, retired employees and beneficiaries of the Hughes Non-Bargaining Retirement Plan, argued that the amendments violated ERISA by providing for an early retirement program and creating an additional noncontributory benefit structure for new participants, among other claims.
 

 Justice Thomas, in delivering the Court's opinion, addressed several key points:
 

 1. **Vested Benefits Claim**: The Court found that the addition of the noncontributory structure did not affect the rights of pre-existing Plan participants. As members of a defined benefit plan, the respondents had no interest in the Plan's surplus. The Court emphasized that the employer bears the investment risk and must cover any underfunding, while also having the discretion to reduce or suspend contributions to an overfunded plan. Thus, Hughes did not deprive respondents of their accrued benefits, and ERISA's vesting provision was not implicated [1].
 

 2. **ERISA's Anti-Inurement Provision**: The Court concluded that Hughes did not violate ERISA's anti-inurement provision by using surplus assets from the contributory structure for the added noncontributory structure. The provision focuses on whether fund assets were used to pay benefits to plan participants, which was the case here. Hughes satisfied its obligations under the Plan and ERISA to ensure adequate funding for the Plan [1].
 

 3. **Fiduciary Duty Claims**: The Court directly foreclosed the respondents' fiduciary duty claims by referencing the *Lockheed Corp. v. Spink* decision, which held that plan sponsors who alter the terms of a plan do not fall into the category of fiduciaries. The Court applied this reasoning regardless of the plan type, emphasizing that the statute's language makes no distinction when defining a fiduciary [1].
 

 4. **Plan Termination**: The Court found that the addition of the noncontributory benefit structure did not require Hughes to terminate the Plan. The respondents conceded that no voluntary termination had occurred, and the Court deemed the common-law theory of a wasting trust inapplicable in this context [1].
 

 In summary, Justice Thomas's opinion for the Court in *Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson* upheld the legality of the Plan's amendments under ERISA, finding that they did not violate the vested benefits claim, the anti-inurement provision, fiduciary duties, or necessitate the Plan's termination.",1,0,0

January*, 94 U.S. 202 (1876), Justice Noah Swayne did not deliver a dissenting opinion. Instead, Justice Swayne delivered the opinion of the court, which was in favor of the defendant, January. The case revolved around the issuance of bonds by the plaintiffs (Commissioners of Johnson County) to the St. Louis, Lawrence, and Denver Railroad Company, of which the defendant, January, was the holder. The court found in favor of January, the defendant in error, and upheld the validity of the bonds issued by the county to the railroad company.
 

 Justice Swayne's opinion addressed several key points:
 

 1. The court recognized the bonds as binding upon the county in the hands of a bona fide holder for value, provided they recited the performance of certain conditions precedent authorized by law [1].
 2. It was determined that the acceptance and holding by the county of the certificate of stock of the company, the issue and delivery of the bonds to the company, and the payment of interest on them for a time, cured any defects related to the order for submitting the question of subscription to a popular vote [1].
 3. The opinion also clarified that an erroneous reference to the act under which the bonds were issued in their recitals did not render them void [1].
 4. Justice Swayne elaborated on the principle that the act of the commissioners was the act of the county, and the county is conclusively bound by what they have done. This established a precedent that as between the county and a bona fide holder, no question involving the infirmity of the securities can be raised [2].
 

 The court's decision was based on the principle of estoppel and the presumption that everything necessary to the validity of the bonds had been properly done, given the actions of the county authorities and the benefits received by the county from the railroad's operation [1],[2].
 

 Therefore, there was no dissenting opinion by Justice Swayne in this case. Instead, his opinion for the court supported the validity of the bonds and the principles of estoppel and bona fide holding in the context of municipal bonds issued for railroad construction.",1,0,0

Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","In the dissenting opinion of Justice Stanley Matthews in *Choctaw Nation v. United States*, 119 U.S. 1 (1886), several key arguments were made. Justice Matthews believed that if the United States had authorized a suit to be brought against them on the Senate award, he would have favored judgment for the Choctaw Nation for the full amount due as found by the court below. He argued that the Senate award had not been abrogated by the bringing of this suit and remained as valid and binding as when it was made. He emphasized that the United States had neglected to pay the awarded amount, but the Choctaw Nation had never released them from the obligation to pay [2].
 

 Justice Matthews also highlighted that the suit was not brought upon the award but upon the treaties, and it should be determined according to the legal rights of the parties as fixed by the treaties, without regard to the Senate's actions under the treaty of 1855. He critiqued the jurisdictional statute, arguing that it did not waive or abrogate the release executed under the act of July 21, 1852, or the treaty of 1855. He pointed out that the Senate, as arbitrators by the treaty of 1855, could consider and act upon the moral obligations of the United States, but the Court of Claims and the Supreme Court could only enforce legal liabilities [2].
 

 Furthermore, Justice Matthews concurred with the Senate committee's decision that the Choctaws were not legally entitled to the proceeds of the land but questioned how much must be paid for the violation of the treaty of 1830 by the United States. He believed that if the release stood, recovery could only be for the unsettled claims of the Choctaws, national and individual. He expressed satisfaction with the Court of Claims' actions but maintained that the United States might have taken advantage of the Indians' necessities, yet the bargain made was carried out by both parties [2].
 

 Justice Matthews' dissent underscores a nuanced interpretation of the legal and moral obligations arising from the treaties between the Choctaw Nation and the United States, advocating for a consideration of the Senate award and the equitable treatment of the Choctaw Nation's claims.",0,1,0

He underscored that the power to tax is a core aspect of state sovereignty, with the Constitution imposing only limited express restrictions on this power. Justice Reed pointed out that while there are certain implied restrictions, they are not numerous, and a state may not tax activities or entities in a manner that discriminates against interstate commerce or unduly burdens it. He also discussed the narrow scope of tax immunities for federal instrumentalities or activities, noting that such immunities are either explicitly provided by Congress or implied to prevent interference with federal functions. However, he argued that the private affairs of federal employees, including military personnel, do not fall within the scope of activities that should be immune from state taxation. Reed contended that Congress acts without constitutional authority when it seeks to protect the private affairs of military personnel from state taxation, as this does not protect a federal function or instrumentality. He concluded that creating tax immunities should be done sparingly and that the tax immunity recognized in the majority opinion was not supported by the Constitution or necessary to prevent a burden on federal functions [1].",0,1,0

Henry Franklin and Wife*, Justice Philip Barbour's dissenting opinion is not explicitly detailed within the provided references. However, the case itself, as outlined in the references, revolves around a dispute concerning the rightful ownership of certain slaves, stock, and household furniture following the death of Joseph Milah.

 The case delves into complex issues of property rights, the validity of contracts, and the interpretation of laws regarding the conveyance of slaves in Louisiana. The court's decision to admit certain evidence over the defendants' objections, including a bill of sale and a deed of gift, played a crucial role in the trial's outcome. The jury ultimately rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, Henry Franklin and his wife, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court [1],[2],[3].

One of the following is true: either this case doesn't exist, the Judge/Justice doesn't exist, the Judge/Justice didn't write a dissenting opinion, or the Judge/Justice delivered the majority opinion. Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","In the Supreme Court case *Clement Smith, Administrator of Samuel Robertson, Deceased, Plaintiff in Error vs. The President and Directors of the Union Bank of Georgetown, Defendant in Error, 30 U.S. 518 (1831)*, Justice William Johnson, in delivering the opinion of the Court, did not present a dissenting opinion. Instead, he articulated the Court's stance on the matter at hand. The case revolved around the administration of the estate of Samuel Robertson, who died indebted to both the Union Bank of Georgetown and a creditor in Virginia. The primary legal question was whether the assets in Robertson's estate should be distributed according to the laws of Maryland (where the assets were located) or Virginia (Robertson's domicile), particularly concerning the priority of debt repayment.
 

 Justice Johnson's opinion clarified the Court's view that the assets should be distributed according to the laws of Maryland, emphasizing that debts are to be treated with equal dignity in administration within Maryland, contrary to Virginia's laws which give preference to bond debts. He reasoned that the law of the place where the contract is made generally governs the contract, but the right of priority does not form part of the contract itself. It is considered intrinsic and dependent on the law of the place where the property lies and where the court sits to decide the cause. This perspective was grounded in the principle that personal property has a situs for the purpose of debt payment through administration, challenging the argument that personal property follows the person and is subject to the laws of the domicile for debt distribution purposes.
 

 Justice Johnson also addressed the broader implications of acknowledging the situs of personal property in legal jurisdictions, highlighting the practical and legal realities of administering estates and satisfying debts. He underscored the importance of local laws in determining the distribution of assets and the resolution of debts, which aligns with the principles of justice and equity in the administration of estates.
 

 In summary, Justice William Johnson's opinion in this case did not represent a dissent but rather the majority view of the Supreme Court, which held that the assets of Samuel Robertson's estate were to be distributed according to the laws of Maryland, where the assets were located, rather than the laws of Virginia, Robertson's domicile [1].",1,0,0

Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","In the 1918 Supreme Court case *Coon v. Kennedy*, 248 U.S. 457, Justice James McReynolds did not provide a dissenting opinion. Instead, he delivered a memorandum opinion for the Court. The case revolved around the applicability of the New Jersey Workmen's Compensation Act to a case of personal injuries governed by maritime law and the retrospective applicability of the Act of Congress approved October 6, 1917. The Court of Errors and Appeals of New Jersey had denied relief to Rebecca Coon, who sought recovery under the New Jersey Workmen's Compensation Act for her husband's death by drowning in navigable waters of the state while employed on a tug boat. The court held that the Act of Congress did not apply retrospectively to the accident, which occurred before the Act's approval, and that the rights of the parties depended upon the maritime law of the United States. Consequently, under the Act of September 6, 1916, the writ of error to review the judgment was improperly sued out and was dismissed. Therefore, Justice McReynolds' opinion was not dissenting but rather a statement of the Court's decision to dismiss the writ of error based on jurisdictional grounds [1].",1,0,0

Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","Justice John Harlan, in his opinion for the court in Smith v. Reeves, addressed the issue of whether a suit against a state officer for the recovery of taxes paid could be considered a suit against the state itself, which would be barred by the Eleventh Amendment if the state did not consent to the suit. The case involved the Receivers of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company seeking to recover taxes paid to the State of California that they believed were wrongfully assessed. The action was brought under a California statute that allowed taxpayers to sue the State Treasurer for the recovery of taxes paid.
 

 Justice Harlan concluded that the suit, although nominally against the state officer, was in reality a suit against the State of California. He reasoned that the judgment sought would compel the officer to pay out of the state treasury, which is equivalent to a judgment against the state itself. This would violate the Eleventh Amendment unless the state consented to be sued. Harlan noted that the State of California had consented to be sued only in its own courts, not in federal courts, and therefore the suit could not proceed in the Circuit Court of the United States.
 

 The opinion further discussed the principles established in previous cases such as Louisiana v. Jumel and Hagood v. Southern, which held that suits against state officers that are essentially suits against the state are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Harlan also referenced the case of Hans v. Louisiana, which established that a state cannot be sued in federal court by its own citizens on the basis of federal questions.
 

 In summary, Justice Harlan's opinion in Smith v. Reeves articulated the doctrine that a suit against a state officer that seeks to affect the state treasury is a suit against the state and is barred by the Eleventh Amendment unless the state consents to such a suit [1],[2].",0,1,0

 The case primarily dealt with the complex interplay between federal tax liens and other claims to a fund, especially in the context of construction contracts and the rights of laborers, materialmen, and finance companies. The majority opinion elaborated on the principles governing the validity of federal tax liens over other claims, the role of state law in determining the nature of property rights for the purpose of federal tax liens, and the specific circumstances under which an assignee could be considered a purchaser with priority over tax claims [1],[2],[5].

 The case primarily dealt with the plaintiffs' claims regarding ""grossly inadequate heating"" at the institution, which they argued led to physical ills and severe personal discomfort, constituting cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. The court's decision to reverse the dismissal of the complaint was based on the argument that the inadequacy in heating could not be justified by the authorities' unintentional failure or their efforts to improve conditions, emphasizing that the result of action or inaction, rather than specific intent, was crucial in determining the violation of constitutional rights [1].

 Justice Black's opinion emphasized the protection afforded by the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination. He argued that compelling a witness to testify in circumstances where the testimony could incriminate the witness violated the Fifth Amendment. This was particularly relevant in this case, where the questions posed to the petitioner concerned her employment by the Communist Party and her intimate knowledge of its operations, at a time when the Smith Act made it a crime to advocate the overthrow of the government by force. Justice Black concluded that the petitioner's fear of self-incrimination was reasonable under these circumstances, and therefore, her refusal to answer the grand jury's questions was protected by the Fifth Amendment.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue*, 300 U.S. 37, Justice James McReynolds did not deliver a dissenting opinion. Instead, he delivered the opinion of the Court. The case revolved around the valuation of cemetery lots for tax purposes, specifically the value of the lots as of March 1, 1913, to determine taxable gains from sales made in later years. The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming the Board of Tax Appeals' decision which supported the cemetery company's valuation of the lots. The Court held that there was substantial evidence to support the Board's finding regarding the value of the cemetery lots and that the reversal by the Circuit Court of Appeals amounted to an unwarranted substitution of judgment concerning facts for that of the Board [1].
 

 Justice McReynolds, in delivering the opinion of the Court, emphasized the principle that where there is substantial evidence to support a finding of the Board of Tax Appeals on a question of fact, its decision is conclusive upon review. The case highlighted the Court's deference to the factual findings of the Board of Tax Appeals when supported by substantial evidence, and it underscored the limited scope of judicial review in such matters [1].",1,0,0

The judges involved in the case, as per the provided context, were Martin, Cole, and Sutton, with Judge Sutton providing a dissenting opinion [1].
 

 Judge Sutton, in his dissent, expressed sympathy for the majority's position on the stay motion but ultimately disagreed with granting it. He argued that Reynolds' request for a stay, and his underlying appeal, were based on a false premise. Specifically, Reynolds contended that a prior decision, Cooey II, was wrongly decided and that the three-judge panel could overrule or sidestep a decision made by a prior panel, which Judge Sutton found untenable. He also considered Reynolds' new argument, not addressed in Getsy, that his 1983 claim was not time-barred because of new developments after filing his appellate briefs. However, Judge Sutton found no substantial change in the state's protocol that would suggest a new procedure risking needless harm to Reynolds, thus not supporting a stay in his case [1].
 

 This dissenting opinion by Judge Sutton focuses on the procedural aspects and the application of precedent rather than introducing new legal theories or interpretations. It underscores the limitations faced by a panel in overruling previous decisions and the challenges in arguing for a stay based on the potential for constitutional harm under the state's execution protocol.",1,0,0

McLean*, 108 U.S. 212 (1883), Justice John Harlan did not provide a dissenting opinion. Instead, he delivered the opinion of the court. The case revolved around the jurisdiction of federal courts and the procedural aspects of removing cases from state courts to federal courts under the act of March 3, 1875. The key points addressed in Justice Harlan's opinion include:
 

 1. **Jurisdiction of Circuit Courts**: The court discussed the jurisdiction of circuit courts of the United States and the regulations concerning the removal of causes from state courts. It was emphasized that the failure to file a copy of the record on or before the first day of the succeeding session of the federal court does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to proceed in the action. The determination of whether to proceed upon the filing of such a copy is at the discretion of the federal court [1].
 

 2. **Discretion of the Circuit Court**: Justice Harlan noted that it was within the sound legal discretion of the circuit court to proceed as if the copy had been filed within the time prescribed by statute. However, the court also had the discretion to determine whether the reasons given for the failure to comply with the law were sufficient [1].
 

 3. **Remand for Failure to File**: The opinion addressed the question of whether a cause should be remanded for failure to file the necessary copy in due time. This was considered a matter of law and fact, and the determination to remand should not be disturbed unless it clearly appeared that the discretion with which the court was invested had been improperly exercised [1].
 

 4. **Filing of a Second Petition for Removal**: The court opined that a party is not entitled to file a second petition for removal on the same grounds where, upon the first removal by the same party, the federal court declined to proceed and remanded the suit because of the party's failure to file the required copy within the time fixed by the statute [1].
 

 Justice Harlan's opinion in this case did not dissent but rather clarified the procedural aspects and the discretion afforded to circuit courts in matters of jurisdiction and the removal of cases from state courts. The emphasis was on the procedural discretion of the federal courts and the limitations on filing subsequent petitions for removal based on the same grounds.",1,0,0

The information provided does not indicate a dissenting opinion by Justice Philip Barbour in this case. Instead, the details available show that Mr. Justice Barbour delivered the opinion of the Court [1]. 
 

 The case involved a dispute over a notarial contract made in 1807, where James Brown and his brother, Samuel Brown, were bound to convey a lot of ground in New Orleans to Richard Raynal Keene. The executor of James Brown, Isaac T. Preston, was sued by Keene for either the conveyance of the lot or its value, claimed to be thirty-seven thousand five hundred dollars at the time of filing the petition. The Circuit Court ruled in favor of Keene, decreeing thirty-one thousand five hundred dollars with costs, and specified conditions under which this judgment would be satisfied [1].
 

 Justice Barbour, in delivering the opinion of the Court, detailed the background of the case, the claims made by Keene, the response by Brown's executor, and the decision of the Circuit Court. The Supreme Court's analysis led to the reversal of the Circuit Court's decree and remanded the case with directions to dismiss the petition [3].

Simms and Wise, Justice John Marshall did not write a dissenting opinion. In fact, he delivered the opinion of the court, which was the majority opinion. The case involved a dispute over the validity of a debtor's discharge from prison and the subsequent avoidance of a creditor's execution. The Supreme Court held that the discharge was fraudulent and void because it was granted by an incompetent tribunal, as one of the magistrates involved had a direct interest in the matter [1].
 

 Justice Marshall's opinion focused on the irregularity of the debtor Simms's schedule of property and the fraudulent nature of the deed of trust that was created to prevent the effect of the plaintiff's execution. He pointed out that the magistrate, Peter Wise, who was also the surety, was directly interested in the case and therefore incompetent to grant the discharge. The court reversed the judgment of the court below on the grounds that the discharge was granted by an interested party and the schedule was not in compliance with the law, rendering the transaction fraudulent on its face [1].

One of the following is true: either this case doesn't exist, the Judge/Justice doesn't exist, the Judge/Justice didn't write a dissenting opinion, or the Judge/Justice delivered the majority opinion. Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","In the case of *Edmund Boyle v. United States*, 556 U.S. 938 (2008), Justice Samuel Alito did not author a dissenting opinion. The confusion may arise from the structure of Supreme Court opinions, where multiple justices can write concurring or dissenting opinions to express their views on the case. However, in this particular case, Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court, which represents the majority view and is not a dissent [1].
 

 The core issue in *Boyle v. United States* revolved around the definition of an ""enterprise"" under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), specifically whether an association-in-fact enterprise must have an ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity in which it engages. Justice Alito, writing for the majority, held that such an enterprise must indeed have a structure, but an instruction framed in this precise language is not necessary for a jury. The Court emphasized that to establish the existence of a RICO enterprise, the government must prove the existence of an ongoing organization with some sort of framework, formal or informal, for carrying out its objectives, and that the various members and associates of the association function as a continuing unit to achieve a common purpose [1].
 

 Therefore, since Justice Alito authored the majority opinion, there was no dissenting opinion from him in this case. If you are interested in dissenting views within this case, you might be referring to the opinions of other justices who participated in the decision.

Specifically, the Court held that in Wisconsin, the fee of mortgaged premises rests in the mortgagee or assignee only after foreclosure and sale, not upon the mere default of the mortgagor. Additionally, the Court found that a deed in fee executed by the mortgagor after the mortgage deed but before foreclosure passes the legal title.

The references provided do not indicate a dissenting opinion by Justice Holmes in this particular case. Instead, Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court, which means he represented the majority view rather than a dissent [2].
 

 In the majority opinion, Justice Holmes addressed the appellant's objections to a tax imposed on its franchise, which the appellant argued was derived from an act of Congress and therefore exempt from taxation. The court rejected this argument, clarifying that the charter granted by the Republic of Hawaii did not become an act of Congress simply because it was ratified and confirmed by the U.S. Congress after Hawaii's annexation. The court held that local legislation under the authority of Congress is treated as emanating from its immediate source, not a superior one, unless explicitly indicated by Congress [2].
 

 Furthermore, the court examined the appellant's claim that its charter exempted it from the tax in question, a property tax. The court found no such exemption in the charter. The decision upheld the valuation of the appellant's entire property, including its franchise, for taxation purposes. The court reasoned that the charter did not provide a clear renunciation of the right to tax, as required by precedent, and that the language of the charter did not imply an exemption from taxes [2].

United States*, 305 U.S. 251, Justice James McReynolds did not provide a dissenting opinion. The confusion may arise from the fact that Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the Court, not a dissent. In the case, the Court addressed issues surrounding the prosecution for possession and transportation of distilled spirits in containers lacking the requisite revenue stamps, in violation of the Liquor Taxing Act of 1934. The Court's decision affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, which found the defendant, Scher, guilty under two counts of an indictment charging violations of the Liquor Taxing Act by possessing and transporting distilled spirits in containers without the necessary revenue stamps [1].
 

 Justice McReynolds' opinion for the Court elaborated on several key points:
 

 1. The defense that the distilled spirits involved were not intended for sale and were therefore excepted from the provisions of the Act must be affirmatively proved [1].
 2. The search of an automobile and seizure of liquor therefrom, without a warrant, after the car had entered a garage appurtenant to a private dwelling, was not deemed an unreasonable search and seizure under the circumstances disclosed in the case [1].
 3. A federal officer who has made an arrest following a tip as to a violation of a federal law may not be required to reveal the identity of his informant, where this is not essential to the defense [1].
 

 Justice McReynolds' opinion supported the legality of the officers' actions based on the circumstances and the information they had received, which led to the observation and subsequent arrest of Scher. The Court's decision emphasized the importance of the officers' observations and actions in the presence of the defendant, rather than the credibility of the informant's tip, in justifying the search and seizure conducted without a warrant [1].

The plaintiffs, including the Western Paper Makers' Chemical Company, challenged the ICC's orders, arguing that the new rates were unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, and violated the long-and-short-haul clause of the Interstate Commerce Act.
 

 Justice Brandeis, writing for the Court, outlined the procedural history and the plaintiffs' objections to the ICC's orders. The Court held that the determination of whether a rate is unreasonable or discriminatory is a question on which the finding of the Commission is conclusive if supported by substantial evidence, unless there was some irregularity in the proceeding or some error in the application of the rules of law. The Court found no such irregularity or error in this case. It was emphasized that the Commission is not hampered by mechanical rules governing the weight or effect of evidence, and the mere admission of matter which under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings would be deemed incompetent does not invalidate its order. The Court concluded that there was ample evidence to support the finding that the joint through rates regarded as entireties were reasonable and justified, and thus upheld the ICC's orders [1].

Instead, the decision details the Supreme Court's ruling on the enforcement of an order by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against Mexia Textile Mills, Inc., with Justice Clark delivering the opinion of the Court [1].
 

 The core issue in this case revolved around the enforcement of the NLRB's order, which required Mexia Textile Mills to cease and desist from certain unfair labor practices. The Court of Appeals had referred the case back to the NLRB for further evidence regarding compliance with the order and the current representational status of the union. The Supreme Court held that the order of the Court of Appeals must be vacated and enforcement of the Board's order decreed, emphasizing that an employer's compliance with a Board order does not render the cause moot nor deprive the Board of its opportunity to secure enforcement from an appropriate court [1].
 

 Justice Frankfurter, joined by Justice Jackson, provided a dissenting opinion, focusing on the procedural aspects and the authority of the Court of Appeals to temporarily withhold enforcement for the purpose of inquiring into compliance with the NLRB's order [3]. Their dissent argued against the majority's view on the relevance of compliance to the enforcement of the Board's order, suggesting that the Court of Appeals' approach was not an abuse of authority but a legitimate inquiry into the circumstances surrounding compliance.
 

 To summarize, Justice Thomas Clark authored the majority opinion, not a dissent, in the case of National Labor Relations Board v. Mexia Textile Mills, Inc., focusing on the enforcement of the NLRB's order against the company for unfair labor practices.

Jackson, 25 U.S. 570 (1827), Justice Robert Trimble did not issue a dissenting opinion. Instead, he delivered the opinion of the Court, which was in favor of the defendant, Jackson. The case revolved around the sufficiency of a notice of sale of real property under a deed of trust. The Court held that no particular form of notice is prescribed by law; it is sufficient if the description of the land is reasonably certain to inform the public of the property to be sold [1].
 

 Justice Trimble's opinion addressed two main points raised by the plaintiff in error (Newman). First, the Court found no merit in the argument that a valid sale of the premises in question could not be made without the aid of a Court of equity. The Court determined that the conveyance from Bronaugh to Moncure, whether regarded as a mortgage or a deed of trust, vested in Moncure the legal title to the premises. Consequently, Moncure's conveyance of the premises by deed to the appellee (Jackson), if regularly made, must be regarded in a Court of law as investing the appellee with the legal title [1].
 

 Second, regarding the plaintiff's objection to the notice of sale, the Court found the notice sufficient despite a mistake in the description of the premises. The Court reasoned that the law has not prescribed a particular form for such a notice, and it is sufficient if it appears calculated reasonably to apprise the public of the property intended to be sold. The Court concluded that the mistake in describing the property as being in ""Peter, Beatty, Threlkeld, and Deakins' addition"" instead of ""Threlkeld's addition"" did not vitiate the notice or render the sale made under it void [1].
 

 Therefore, Justice Trimble's opinion, which represented the Court's decision, did not dissent but rather affirmed the judgment of the Court below in favor of Jackson, addressing and dismissing the concerns raised by Newman.",1,0,0

Instead, Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court, which focused on the interpretation of the federal witness tampering statute, specifically under 18 U.S.C. 1512(a)(1)(C) [1]. The Court held that, in circumstances where a defendant kills a person with the intent to prevent that person from communicating with law enforcement officers in general, the Government must show that there was a reasonable likelihood that a relevant communication would have been made to a federal officer [1].
 

 The case revolved around the sufficiency of evidence required to prove that the defendant intended to prevent communication with a federal law enforcement officer, even when the defendant did not have federal officers specifically in mind at the time of the offense [1]. The Court's decision clarified the government's burden in cases involving the federal witness tampering statute, emphasizing the need for a showing of a reasonable likelihood of communication with federal law enforcement in the absence of specific intent towards federal officers [1].
 

 Therefore, the premise of Justice Breyer writing a dissenting opinion in this case is incorrect, as he authored the majority opinion that resolved the interpretative issue regarding the federal witness tampering statute.",1,0,0

Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","Justice James McReynolds, in his dissenting opinion in the case of Valley Farms Co. v. Westchester, argued that the act in question was unconstitutional because it deprived the plaintiff of property without just compensation and without due process of law. He contended that the property was assessed equally with all other property within the assessment area for the whole cost of the sanitary outlet sewer and the sanitary trunk sewer, despite the fact that the plaintiff's property could not make use of the sanitary trunk sewer and only partial use of the sanitary outlet sewer. McReynolds pointed out that such use would only begin upon the construction of additional infrastructure, which would incur significant costs [1].
 

 Furthermore, McReynolds emphasized that the assessments were disproportionate to the benefits received because they were based solely on the assessments for general taxation, which resulted in arbitrary adoption of the value of the lots as laid out on the tax maps without regard to frontage, depth, or distance from the sewer. He also highlighted that the assessments on improved property were based on the assessed value of lands and buildings, while those on vacant property were based on the assessed value of the land alone, which he argued was disproportionate to benefits [1].
 

 Additionally, McReynolds criticized the legislative process, stating that the Legislature had disregarded the constitutional rights of property owners by sweeping away previously fixed rights and liabilities and substituting a different assessment area without notice to the property owners. He referenced previous cases to support his view that if an act imposes an unjust and unequal assessment disproportionate to the benefits conferred, it is unconstitutional [1].
 

 In summary, Justice McReynolds's dissent in Valley Farms Co. v. Westchester was grounded in the principles of due process and just compensation, arguing that the assessments were arbitrary, disproportionate, and enacted without proper notice and hearing, thus violating the constitutional rights of the property owner.",0,1,0

United States Ex Rel. B. Coles Neidecker*, 299 U.S. 5 (1936), there was no dissenting opinion by Justice Charles Hughes as he actually delivered the opinion of the Court [1]. The confusion might arise from the nature of judicial decisions where multiple opinions can be presented, including majority, concurring, and dissenting opinions. However, in this particular case, Justice Hughes articulated the Court's majority opinion.
 

 The core of the Court's decision, as delivered by Justice Hughes, revolved around the limitations of executive power in the extradition process, specifically in the absence of explicit authorization by treaty or statute. The Court held that the Executive has no inherent power to extradite fugitive criminals except as provided by treaty or Act of Congress. It was determined that the Act of Congress defining the procedure in extradition cases did not confer power on the Executive to surrender any person to a foreign government where no extradition treaty or convention provides for such surrender. Furthermore, the Court found that the extradition treaty with France did not grant the Executive discretionary power to surrender citizens of the United States for extradition [1].
 

 This decision affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, which had directed the discharge of the respondents, native-born citizens of the United States charged with crimes in France, from custody under preliminary warrants of extradition. The Court's analysis underscored the principle that the power to extradite, being a national power, is not vested in the Executive by default but must be explicitly conferred through legislative or treaty-based provisions [1].

J. A. Croson Company*, 488 U.S. 469 (1989). Instead, she delivered the opinion of the Court, which held that the City of Richmond's Minority Business Utilization Plan, requiring prime contractors awarded city construction contracts to subcontract at least 30% of the dollar amount of each contract to minority business enterprises, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment [2].
 

 The Court's decision, as articulated by Justice O'Connor, was based on two primary grounds. First, the city failed to demonstrate a compelling governmental interest justifying the Plan, as the factual predicate supporting the Plan did not establish the type of identified past discrimination in the city's construction industry that would authorize race-based relief under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The Court found that a generalized assertion of past discrimination in the entire construction industry could not justify the use of an unyielding racial quota [2].
 

 Second, the Plan was not narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of prior discrimination. The Court criticized the Plan for entitling a black, Hispanic, or Oriental entrepreneur from anywhere in the country to an absolute preference over other citizens based solely on their race, without considering whether the particular minority business seeking a racial preference had suffered from the effects of past discrimination by the city or prime contractors [2].
 

 Justice O'Connor's opinion emphasized the need for strict scrutiny of any race-based governmental action, requiring that such action be justified by a compelling governmental interest and be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The decision in *City of Richmond v. J. A. Croson Company* set a significant precedent for evaluating the constitutionality of race-conscious affirmative action programs implemented by state and local governments [2].",1,0,0

The case concerned the question of whether the right to print and publish a map, which was protected by copyright, could be transferred along with the sale of the physical copperplate used to print the map.

 The arguments presented by Justice Nelson in the majority opinion focused on the distinction between the physical property (the copperplate) and the intellectual property (the copyright of the map).

County of Fresno, 429 U.S. 452 (1976), Justice Byron White, in his dissenting opinion, raised several points of contention against the majority's decision. His dissent focused on the implications of the California tax scheme on federal employees and the federal government, contrasting it with previous cases and the principles established by the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.
 

 Justice White argued that the California tax scheme, which imposed a possessory interest tax on federal employees using federally owned property, was discriminatory and ran afoul of the Supremacy Clause. He highlighted that this tax did not apply uniformly, as it exempted certain users of tax-exempt property, such as private hospitals, schools, or religious organizations, thereby creating a discriminatory tax against federal employees [1].
 

 He further differentiated the California tax scheme from the Michigan taxes upheld in previous cases, noting that the Michigan taxes were designed to eliminate disparities in tax treatment and were applied uniformly to all users of tax-exempt property. In contrast, the California tax created inequality by targeting a specific group of federal employees, thus discriminating against them [1].
 

 Justice White also expressed concern over the potential conflict between state and federal interests, emphasizing that the tax could have a different practical effect on federal employees compared to other individuals using tax-exempt property. He argued that such a tax could lead to a significant potential conflict between the interests of the two sovereigns within the same territory, which would be contrary to the principles established in McCulloch v. Maryland [1].
 

 In summary, Justice Byron White's dissent in United States et al. v. County of Fresno focused on the discriminatory nature of the California possessory interest tax, its inconsistency with the Supremacy Clause, and the potential for conflict between state and federal interests. He contrasted the California scheme with previous cases where taxes were applied uniformly, underscoring the importance of equality in tax treatment and the avoidance of discriminatory practices against federal employees [1].",0,1,0

This means that all Justices agreed with the opinion and there were no dissenting opinions written in this case [1].
 

 The core issue in Whren v. United States was whether the temporary detention of a motorist, who the police have probable cause to believe has committed a civil traffic violation, is inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures unless a reasonable officer would have been motivated to stop the car by a desire to enforce the traffic laws. Justice Scalia, writing for the unanimous Court, held that the temporary detention of a motorist upon probable cause to believe that he has violated the traffic laws does not violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures, even if a reasonable officer would not have stopped the motorist absent some additional law enforcement objective [1].
 

 Justice Scalia's opinion clarified that the subjective intentions of the police officers involved do not invalidate the legality of a traffic stop if it is justified by probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred. This decision underscored the principle that as long as the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify the action taken by law enforcement, the stop is consistent with the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the officer's subjective intent [1].

The case revolved around the deductibility of losses due to embezzlement under the Internal Revenue Code, specifically sections 23(e) and (f), and Treasury Regulations. The Court held that whether and when a deductible loss results from an embezzlement is a factual question to be decided according to surrounding circumstances. It was determined that under the special factual circumstances found by the District Courts in the two cases involved, the taxpayers were entitled to deductions for the year in which the embezzlement losses were discovered and their amounts ascertained [1].
 

 Justice Black's opinion emphasized the practical considerations in determining the timing for deducting losses due to embezzlement, acknowledging the secretive nature of embezzlement and the potential for recovery of embezzled funds. The opinion also highlighted the longstanding Treasury practice of allowing deductions for embezzlement losses in years subsequent to those in which the thefts occurred, to prevent hardships and injustice. This approach was deemed consistent with the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations [1].

Instead, Chief Justice Marshall delivered the opinion of the Court, which addressed the admissibility and competency of secondary evidence in proving the contents of a written contract that was alleged to have been lost or destroyed [1].
 

 The case revolved around a dispute over a contract for the purchase of stock, where the plaintiff, Elisha Riggs, sought to recover a sum of money paid to John Tayloe under a contract that Riggs alleged was not fulfilled as agreed. The core legal issue pertained to whether parol evidence could be admitted to prove the contents of the written contract, given that the original document was not available because it was claimed to have been lost or destroyed [1].
 

 Chief Justice Marshall, in delivering the Court's opinion, elaborated on the conditions under which secondary evidence could be admitted in such circumstances. He discussed the necessity of proving the loss or destruction of the original document to the satisfaction of the court, which could then allow for secondary evidence to be considered. The opinion also touched upon the broader legal principles regarding the admissibility of a party's affidavit to establish the loss of a document and the implications for proving the contents of a lost or destroyed contract [1].
 

 Therefore, based on the information available, there was no dissenting opinion by Justice John Marshall in this case. Instead, he authored the majority opinion for the Court, which provided a detailed analysis of the legal issues surrounding the use of secondary evidence in contract disputes where the original document is unavailable [1].",1,0,0

One of the following is true: either this case doesn't exist, the Judge/Justice doesn't exist, the Judge/Justice didn't write a dissenting opinion, or the Judge/Justice delivered the majority opinion. Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","In the case of *Clinton v. Missouri Pacific Railway*, 122 U.S. 469 (1887), Justice Samuel Miller, in his opinion, addressed several key points regarding the timing and procedural aspects of appeals in cases involving the assessment of damages by commissioners appointed by a county court. The crux of the dissent revolved around the interpretation of when the statutory time limit for taking an appeal begins to run.
 

 Justice Miller argued that the Circuit Court for the District of Nebraska erred in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal on the grounds that it was not taken within the statutory sixty days. He contended that the sixty-day period should start from the day the commissioners filed their award and assessment of damages with the county court, not from the earlier date when the commissioners viewed the land. This interpretation was based on the premise that the assessment of damages could not be considered as having been made until the commissioners had concluded upon and signed a final report on the subject [1],[2].
 

 Furthermore, Justice Miller pointed out that the Supreme Court of Nebraska had decided in a similar case (*Gifford v. The Republican Valley and Kansas Railroad*, 20 Neb. 538) that the sixty-day period for appealing the award of commissioners begins to run only after the commissioners present their report to the county court. This, according to Miller, indicated that the judgment of the Circuit Court, which was under review, was evidently erroneous [2].
 

 Another significant point raised by Justice Miller was regarding the sufficiency of the transcript filed in the District Court. He argued that what was filed was enough to give the District Court jurisdiction to proceed further in the case. The transcript contained the order appointing the commissioners, their swearing-in, the report they made, the award of damages, and the taking of the appeal by Clinton, which Miller deemed sufficient to show that a case had arisen which the statute intended might be brought before that court on appeal [2].
 

 Justice Miller's dissent thus focused on the procedural aspects of how and when an appeal should be considered timely and the sufficiency of the record for appellate review. His arguments highlighted the importance of a clear understanding of the statutory requirements for appeals and the procedural safeguards necessary to ensure that parties have a fair opportunity to challenge decisions affecting their rights.",0,1,0

Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","In the case of *Robert Brockett et Al., Appellants, v. William Brockett et Al., Defendants*, 44 U.S. 691 (1845), Justice John McLean did not provide a dissenting opinion. Instead, he delivered the opinion of the court. The confusion may arise from the nature of the case and the detailed explanation provided by Justice McLean regarding the court's decision-making process and the legal principles applied.
 

 In his opinion, Justice McLean outlined the procedural and substantive aspects of the case, emphasizing the importance of following specific procedural rules when issues are directed from a court of chancery to be tried by a court of law. He highlighted that objections raised during the trial must be brought to the notice and decision of the court of chancery that directed the issue for trial. If this step is not taken, such objections cannot be considered in an appellate court of chancery [1].
 

 Justice McLean further explained that the same principle applies regardless of whether the same judges sit in both the court of law and the court of chancery. He clarified that the capacities in which the tribunal acts on such occasions are distinct, akin to when a court that exercises both legal and chancery powers is asked to invoke its chancery powers against its own judgment in a legal matter [1].
 

 The opinion also addressed the handling of exceptions to the master's report in chancery proceedings. Justice McLean pointed out that objections to the master's report must be filed in the lower court within a specified period, as dictated by the seventy-third chancery rule of the court. Failure to file exceptions within this timeframe means that the report stands confirmed, and no objections can be heard in the appellate court [1].
 

 In summary, Justice McLean's opinion in the case did not constitute a dissent but rather a comprehensive explanation of the court's decision to affirm the decree of the Circuit Court. The opinion focused on procedural requirements for raising objections in chancery cases and the distinctions between the roles of courts when acting in legal versus chancery capacities [1].",1,0,0

The opinions expressed in the case were by these judges, with Judge MacKinnon dissenting in part and concurring in the remand [1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10].
 

 The dissenting opinion in part by Senior Circuit Judge MacKinnon raised concerns about whether the lawsuit brought by Mayerson, the attorney for American Airways Charters, Inc. (AAC), was properly authorized by the responsible officers or directors of AAC. He questioned the broad authority given to Mayerson by the then-president of AAC, Fernando Fuentes, and whether this constituted proper authorization for the specific lawsuit. Judge MacKinnon also highlighted the need for the district court to address these issues on remand, given the complexity of the case and the unsatisfactory state of the factual record for appellate review [8].
 

 Judge MacKinnon's dissent also touched upon the authority of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) under the Trading With the Enemy Act, suggesting that employment contracts, including those for legal services, could fall within the range of transactions for which OFAC may require licenses. He emphasized the constitutional power vested in the President and Congress to oversee foreign affairs and the broad authority granted to the Executive Branch under the Act [9].

Justice Roberts contended that the presumption was not based on a rational connection between the fact proved (prior conviction and possession) and the ultimate fact presumed (receipt of the firearm in interstate commerce after the statute's effective date). He believed that the presumption imposed an unfair and practically impossible burden of proof on the defendant and that it violated due process by not meeting the tests previously laid down by the Court [1].

 The core issue before the Court was whether the term ""debt collector"" in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) applies to a lawyer who ""regularly,"" through litigation, tries to collect consumer debts. The Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, holding that the FDCPA does apply to lawyers engaged in litigation activities aimed at collecting consumer debts. The Court reasoned that a lawyer who regularly tries to obtain payment of consumer debts through legal proceedings meets the Act's definition of ""debt collector"" and that Congress intended for the FDCPA to apply to such activities, even after it repealed an earlier exemption for lawyers in 1986 [1].
 

 Justice Breyer's opinion for the Court addressed several arguments against this interpretation, including concerns about the application of the Act's requirements to litigation activities and the potential for anomalous results. However, the Court found these arguments unconvincing and emphasized the broad definition of ""debt collector"" within the FDCPA, the legislative history of the 1986 amendment, and the importance of the Act's consumer protection goals [1].

City National Bank of Wichita Falls et al.*, 306 U.S. 103 (1938), the dissenting opinion by Justice Harlan Stone is not directly detailed within the provided references. The references focus on the majority opinion and the legal reasoning behind the court's decision, particularly regarding the application of Texas law by the federal court and the liability of a bank for trust funds misappropriated by a trustee. 
 

 The case primarily dealt with the liability of a bank in situations where trust funds were commingled with a trustee's personal account and later misappropriated. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision that the bank was liable for the trustee's misappropriations to the extent it participated in them, especially after knowingly accepting trust funds in payment of the trustee's personal debts. The court emphasized the duty of the federal court to apply Texas law as declared by its highest court and found that the opinion of the Supreme Court of Texas in this case had not been modified by another case (Quanah case) and must be accepted as stating the law of Texas [1].
 

 Unfortunately, without specific details from the dissenting opinion in the references provided, it's not possible to accurately convey Justice Harlan Stone's arguments in his dissent. Dissenting opinions often provide a different perspective on the case, focusing on different legal principles or interpretations of the law than those emphasized by the majority. They can highlight concerns about the majority's reasoning or the potential implications of the decision. However, without the text of Justice Stone's dissent, these aspects cannot be detailed here.

Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","In the case of Gray v. Bostic, 720 F.3d 887 (2013), the dissenting opinion by Circuit Judge Wilson focused on three main points regarding the awarding of attorney's fees to Laquarius Gray, the prevailing party in the litigation against Antonio Bostic. 
 

 Firstly, Judge Wilson disagreed with the majority's assessment of the first factor from the Supreme Court's decision in Farrar v. Hobby, which considers the degree of success obtained by the plaintiff. While the majority believed this factor favored Bostic because Gray received only nominal damages, Judge Wilson argued that the failure to obtain the full damages sought by Gray did not heavily weigh against her, especially when compared to the significantly larger amount sought and failed to be obtained in Farrar itself [1].
 

 Secondly, on the significance of the legal issue at hand, Judge Wilson contended that Gray's litigation was significant because it involved a clear violation of Fourth Amendment rights. This was contrary to the majority's view that the litigation could not be significant since it did not change the law. Judge Wilson highlighted Gray's success in overcoming Bostic's qualified immunity claims at various stages of the litigation as evidence of the significance of her victory [1].
 

 Lastly, regarding the third Farrar factor, which considers whether the litigation accomplished a public goal beyond occupying the time and energy of counsel, court, and client, Judge Wilson criticized the majority's narrow view on the incentivization of civil rights litigation through attorney's fees. He argued that Gray's litigation served a clear public purpose by setting a precedent that could deter future violations of students' rights by government actors [1].
 

 In summary, Judge Wilson's dissent in Gray v. Bostic argued that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney's fees to Gray, emphasizing the significance of her litigation in terms of both the degree of success obtained and the public purpose served [1].",0,1,0

Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","In the Supreme Court case Railroad Company v. Lockwood, 84 U.S. 357 (1873), Justice Joseph Bradley did not deliver a dissenting opinion; rather, he delivered the majority opinion for the Court. In his opinion, Justice Bradley addressed several key legal principles regarding the responsibilities and liabilities of common carriers, particularly in relation to contracts that aim to limit a carrier's liability for negligence [1].
 

 Justice Bradley articulated that a common carrier cannot lawfully stipulate for exemption from responsibility when such exemption is not just and reasonable in the eye of the law. He emphasized that it is not just and reasonable for a common carrier to stipulate for exemption from responsibility for the negligence of itself or its servants. This principle, he noted, applies with special force to common carriers of passengers, including cases where a drover travels on a stock train to look after his cattle and receives a free pass for that purpose [1].
 

 The opinion further held that a common carrier does not lose its character as such merely by entering into a contract for limiting its responsibility. Justice Bradley underscored that carefulness and fidelity are essential duties of a common carrier's employment, which cannot be abdicated. He clarified that a failure to fulfill these duties constitutes negligence, making the distinction between ""gross"" and ""ordinary"" negligence unnecessary for the determination of liability in this context [1].
 

 Justice Bradley's opinion in Railroad Company v. Lockwood thus established significant precedents regarding the limits of contractual exemptions from liability for common carriers, particularly emphasizing the protection of passengers and the public interest against negligence by carriers and their servants [1].",1,0,0

The key arguments made in the court's opinion, delivered by Justice Gray, centered around the completeness of a contract of guaranty and the necessity of mutual assent of the parties for the formation of a contract. The court held that the contract of guaranty was not complete because the guarantor was not liable for the price of goods sold by the corporation to the agent and not paid for by him, as there was no evidence of any request from the plaintiff corporation to the guarantors, or of any consideration moving from it and received or acknowledged by them at the time of their signing the guaranty. Furthermore, the guarantors had no notice that their sufficiency had been approved, or that their guaranty had been accepted, or even that the original contract had been executed or assented to by the plaintiff, until long afterwards when payment was demanded of them [1].

The court found that Dufief had lent the money to Wheeler on good and sufficient security and that the subsequent loss was due to the negligence of Mrs. Fowler and her husband, not Dufief.

The panel consisted of Judges Prost, Newman, and Taranto. The decision, authored by Chief Judge Prost, affirmed the Court of International Trade's classification of Belimo's imports as electric motors under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), specifically under subheading 8501.10.40, rather than as automatic regulating and controlling instruments and apparatus under HTSUS 9032.89.60 [1].
 

 The court's analysis focused on whether Belimo's products, which are used in heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, should be classified based on their function of regulating air flow and temperature or simply as electric motors. The court agreed with the lower court that Belimo's imports, despite incorporating additional parts and components like the ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit), did not change the principal function of the subject imports as electric motors. The ASIC's role in improving the precision and reliability of the motor's operation was seen as complementary to the motor's principal function [1].

The majority opinion addressed the interpretation of the Act of April 28, 1904, and its application to the conveyance of land within the right of way of the Northern Pacific Railway. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the state court, holding that the act did not authorize the acquisition of title by adverse possession subsequent to its passage and that the act was intended to validate only conveyances made prior to its enactment [1].
 

 The majority opinion clarified that while a remedial statute should be construed to include the remedies it was intended to afford, its words should not be extended to destroy express limitations or to accomplish purposes not intended by the text of the statute [1]. The court concluded that the act was meant to cure infirmities in titles that had become complete prior to the passage of the act, and it did not contemplate future disposals of the right of way or future adverse possessions [1].

Wilson*, 151 U.S. 551 (1894), Justice David Brewer did not deliver a dissenting opinion. Instead, he delivered the opinion of the court. The case revolved around a dispute where the plaintiff, Edward H. Lewis, consented to a reduction of a verdict from ten thousand to five thousand dollars after a jury awarded damages for libel. This consent was given under the condition that if the defendants declined to pay the reduced amount and sought to prosecute a writ of error to the Supreme Court, the judgment would revert to the original ten thousand dollars. The defendants agreed to pay the reduced sum, and the plaintiff acknowledged receipt of this amount in full satisfaction of the judgment. Later, the plaintiff moved the court to enter a new judgment for the full ten thousand dollars, arguing that the court had no power to grant a new trial or modify the verdict after a certain period post-verdict, among other points.
 

 Justice Brewer, in delivering the opinion of the court, described the case as ""most extraordinary"" due to the plaintiff's attempt to secure a new judgment for double the amount after formally acknowledging full satisfaction with the reduced judgment. The court's decision focused on the procedural aspects and the plaintiff's consent to the reduced verdict, emphasizing the finality of such an agreement when duly entered into the court's record. Brewer's opinion did not support the plaintiff's contention that the court lacked the power to modify the verdict or that the defendants' motion for a new trial was invalid due to timing constraints under Florida law. Instead, the opinion highlighted the significance of the plaintiff's consent to the verdict reduction and the acknowledgment of payment, which precluded the plaintiff from seeking further recovery [1].
 

 Therefore, the query about Justice David Brewer's dissenting opinion in this case is based on a misunderstanding. Justice Brewer actually authored the majority opinion for the court, addressing the legal issues surrounding the modification of the verdict and the implications of the plaintiff's actions post-verdict.",1,0,0

The Court's decision was based on the findings that the conditions of confinement, including double celling, did not lead to deprivations of essential food, medical care, or sanitation, nor did they increase violence among inmates or create other conditions intolerable for prison confinement [4]. 
 

 Justice Powell's opinion emphasized that the conditions of confinement must not involve the wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain, nor may they be grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime warranting imprisonment. The opinion also highlighted that while the conditions of confinement can be restrictive and even harsh, they are part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society.

 The case primarily dealt with the legal proceedings and the acknowledgment of deeds within the context of the District of Columbia and the laws of Maryland prior to Congress legislating for the District. The Court's decision elaborated on the validity of a deed executed by a guardian appointed by the Court of the state of Maryland, the acknowledgment of deeds, and the jurisdiction of Maryland courts over property in the District of Columbia before Congress assumed jurisdiction. The opinion, delivered by Chief Justice Taney, affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court, thereby supporting the execution and acknowledgment of the deed in question and the applicability of Maryland law prior to Congressional intervention in the District of Columbia [1].
 

 Given the context and the details provided, there is no specific mention or indication of a dissenting opinion by Justice Roger Taney in this case. The focus is on the majority opinion that he delivered, which addressed the legal intricacies of the case and upheld the lower court's decision.",1,0,0

Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","In the case of *Woodard v. United States*, 254 F.2d 312 (1958), the provided references do not include a dissenting opinion by Judge Van Oosterhout, as the decision was rendered per curiam by Judges Prettyman, Fahy, and Burger. The per curiam opinion detailed the circumstances surrounding the search and seizure of evidence from Woodard and a co-defendant, ultimately affirming the legality of the search and the convictions for robbery, unauthorized use of an automobile, and the transportation in interstate commerce of a falsely made and forged check [1].
 

 The per curiam decision elaborated on the reasonableness of the search based on the circumstances presented, emphasizing the role of Mrs. Berry, the householder, in discovering and reporting the suspicious items to the police, which led to the search and seizure. The court found no unreasonable search or seizure, highlighting the exceptional circumstances that dispensed with the necessity for a search warrant [1].
 

 Given the information available, it appears there was no dissenting opinion by Judge Van Oosterhout in this case as he was not listed among the judges involved in the decision. The confusion might stem from a mix-up with another case or an incorrect citation. If you have any further questions or need clarification on related legal principles, feel free to ask.",1,0,0

Spears*, 570 U.S. 48 (2013). Instead, Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court, which was joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Breyer, and Alito [1]. The dissenting opinion in this case was written by Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justices Scalia, Sotomayor, and Kagan [1]. 
 

 In the majority opinion delivered by Justice Kennedy, the Supreme Court held that the solicitation of clients by attorneys is not a permissible purpose covered by the litigation exception (subsection (b)(4)) of the Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA). The Court emphasized that when the use of DPPA-protected personal information has the predominant purpose of solicitation, it is not protected by the (b)(4) litigation exception [1]. This decision necessitated a remand for the lower courts to apply the correct standard in determining the predominant purpose of the respondents' letters, which were at the heart of the case [2].
 

 The dissenting opinion, as mentioned, was authored by Justice Ginsburg, who argued against the majority's interpretation of the DPPA, particularly criticizing the majority's narrow view on the permissible uses of personal information obtained from motor vehicle records under the DPPA [3]. 
 

 Therefore, the query about Justice Kennedy's dissenting opinion seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the roles played by the justices in this case. Justice Kennedy was in fact the author of the majority opinion, not a dissent.",1,0,0

 The majority opinion, as outlined in the references, focuses on the appeal by the state of Mississippi against the grant of habeas relief to Donna Brooks, who was convicted of selling controlled substances near a church. The court's decision to reverse the grant of habeas relief was based on the evidence presented at trial, including an audio recording of the drug transaction, eyewitness testimony, and the chemical composition of the drugs confirmed by a crime-lab analyst. The court also discussed the standards for claiming ineffective assistance of counsel under *Strickland v. Washington*, emphasizing the strong presumption of adequacy of counsel's performance and the requirement for a petitioner to show both deficient performance and prejudice [2].
 

 Without specific reference to a dissenting opinion by Judge Swan in the provided context, it's not possible to detail the arguments that might have been made in such a dissent.

Hoyt, 16 U.S. 246 (1818), Justice Joseph Story did not provide a dissenting opinion as he actually delivered the opinion of the court [2]. The confusion might arise from the complex nature of early 19th-century legal documentation and the multiple issues addressed within a single case. However, the key arguments and legal reasoning in the case, as delivered by Justice Story, focused on several pivotal points.
 

 Firstly, the case involved the legality of a seizure under the laws of the United States, specifically addressing whether a state court could entertain or decide questions of forfeiture for seizures made under federal law [10]. Justice Story articulated that the courts of the United States have exclusive cognizance of questions of forfeiture upon all seizures made under the laws of the United States. This means that it is not within the competence of a state court to entertain or decide such a question of forfeiture [10].
 

 Furthermore, the opinion clarified that if a sentence of condemnation is definitively pronounced by the proper court of the United States, it is conclusive that a forfeiture is incurred. Conversely, if a sentence of acquittal is issued, it is equally conclusive against the forfeiture. In either scenario, the question cannot be relitigated in any common-law forum [10].
 

 Justice Story also addressed the procedural aspects related to actions of trespass in cases of seizure for supposed forfeiture under U.S. law. He noted that no action of trespass lies in any common-law tribunal until a final decree is pronounced upon the proceeding in rem to enforce such forfeiture. This is because the legality of the seizure—and whether it is deemed rightful or tortious—depends on the final decree of the court proceeding in rem [10].
 

 In summary, Justice Story's opinion in Gelston, et al. v. Hoyt emphasized the exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts over questions of forfeiture under U.S. law, the conclusive nature of sentences of condemnation or acquittal by competent courts, and the procedural requirements for actions of trespass related to seizures for supposed forfeiture.",1,0,0

 In the majority opinion, Justice McKinley addressed several points of contention.

Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","In the case of *Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota*, 246 U.S. 450 (1918), Justice Willis Van Devanter did not author a dissenting opinion. In fact, Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court, which was in favor of the State of Minnesota. The Supreme Court held that the tax imposed on the Cudahy Packing Company by the State of Minnesota was a property tax, not a tax on gross earnings burdening interstate commerce. This decision affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota.
 

 Justice Van Devanter's opinion clarified that as long as the property, both tangible and intangible, constituting a freight car line, is regularly and habitually used or employed in a State, it falls within the taxing power of that State even if it is chiefly devoted or applied to interstate transportation. The tax can be levied at its real value as part of a going concern. The Court also noted that in determining whether a state tax is viewed as a tax on property measured by earnings or a tax on earnings, the perspective of the state court and legislature, while not conclusive, will not be rejected unless ill-founded. The opinion further elaborated that the tax in question was treated by the state court and legislature as a property tax and was not in excess of what would be legitimate as an ordinary tax on such property, tangible and intangible, taken at its real value as part of a going concern [1].
 

 Therefore, there was no dissenting opinion by Justice Willis Van Devanter in this case. The confusion might arise from the nature of judicial opinions and the roles justices play in them. In this instance, Justice Van Devanter authored the majority opinion, supporting the state's right to tax the property used by the Cudahy Packing Company within Minnesota, underlining the principle that such taxation does not constitute an unconstitutional restraint or burden on interstate commerce.",1,0,0

Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","In the case of Southern Railway Company v. St. Louis Hay & Grain Company, Justice David Brewer dissented from the majority opinion. In his dissent, Justice Brewer argued that a carrier, in this case, the railway company, is entitled to compensation beyond the actual expense incurred when stopping goods in transit for inspection and reloading at the request of the shipper. He contended that the service provided by the carrier is of some benefit to the shipper and involves additional service and expense to the carrier. Therefore, the carrier should not be limited to charging only the actual cost of this service but is justified in receiving some compensation in addition to that.
 

 Justice Brewer drew an analogy with the provision of sleeping or other accommodations by a carrier to its passengers, stating that a carrier is not limited to charging merely the cost but may make a reasonable profit. He emphasized that the privilege of stopping goods for inspection and reloading is not a part of the transportation but is outside of it, and thus, the carrier is entitled to receive compensation beyond mere cost for this additional service [1],[2].
 

 This dissenting opinion highlights Justice Brewer's view that the Interstate Commerce Commission and the lower courts erred in limiting the carrier's charge to only the actual cost incurred for the additional service provided to the shipper. He believed that a reasonable charge could include a profit margin and not just the recovery of expenses.",0,1,0

Any of these is a valid answer. The only incorrect answer would be to describe a dissenting opinion by this Judge/Justice that doesn't exist.","In the case of Mares v. Conagra Poultry Co., 971 F.2d 492 (1992), the dissenting opinion was provided by Circuit Judge Tacha. Judge Tacha's dissent focused on several key points regarding the handling of the invasion of privacy claim brought by Carmela Mares against ConAgra Poultry Company, Inc. [3].
 

 Judge Tacha disagreed with the majority's conclusion that Mares had failed to carry her summary judgment burden. The dissent argued that ConAgra did not meet its initial burden of showing that it was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. This was based on the assertion that ConAgra's justification for the medications form, which was to ensure the accuracy of drug test results and allow employees to explain positive test results, did not eliminate all genuine issues of material fact [3].
 

 Furthermore, Judge Tacha criticized the majority for requiring Mares to produce evidence to refute ConAgra's justification for the medications form. The dissent pointed out that it was unlikely Mares could present any evidence other than the medications form itself, which was already a powerful piece of evidence. The dissent also highlighted that the majority did not specify what type of evidence Mares could possibly produce to meet this burden [3].
 

 Additionally, Judge Tacha expressed concern over the majority's decision to shift the burden of producing summary judgment evidence to Mares. The dissent argued that this was incorrect and that the majority decided without any indication from the Supreme Court of Colorado that the alleged intrusion in this case was insignificant. Judge Tacha believed that the certification procedure was an underutilized mechanism that could allow important, purely state law questions to be decided by the highest court of the state involved [4].
 

 In summary, Judge Tacha's dissent in Mares v. Conagra Poultry Co. focused on the belief that ConAgra did not meet its burden of proof for summary judgment, criticized the majority for shifting the burden of proof to Mares, and suggested that the case presented important questions of Colorado law that should be decided by the Colorado Supreme Court.",0,1,0

 To address your query regarding dissenting opinions, generally, a dissenting opinion is written by one or more judges expressing disagreement with the majority opinion of the court.

Jackson, 16 U.S. 449 (1818), Justice Thomas Todd did not provide a dissenting opinion. Instead, Justice Todd delivered the opinion of the court. The case revolved around the priority of land conveyances in Kentucky and the interpretation of deeds related to the same parcel of land. The key issue was whether a deed executed later but recorded earlier than another deed for the same land should have priority. 
 

 Justice Todd, in delivering the court's opinion, focused on the specific language and intent of the conveyances from Henry Lee to Adam Craig and Henry Lee to Henry Banks. The court concluded that the conveyance to Banks was intended to operate only upon lands that Lee held at the time of his conveyance, which he derived from Alexander Skinner, and not on the land specifically conveyed to Craig. This interpretation was based on the understanding that the conveyance to Banks was limited to the rights, titles, and claims that Skinner had at the time of his death and that Lee held at the time of his conveyance. The court reasoned that this construction was reasonable, founded on the apparent intent of the parties, and allowed both deeds to stand together without fraud upon the prior purchaser [1].
 

 Therefore, since Justice Todd delivered the majority opinion and there was no mention of a dissenting opinion by him in the provided context, it appears there was a misunderstanding regarding his role in this case. Justice Todd's arguments were, in fact, the court's majority view, focusing on the interpretation of the conveyance terms and the intent behind them to determine the priority of the deeds in question.",1,0,0

This case, decided on June 26, 1984, involved a challenge to a Maryland statute that restricted the percentage of fundraising expenses a charitable organization could incur. The Supreme Court held that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad as it imposed a direct restriction on protected First Amendment activity without a sufficiently precise means of accomplishing the state's objectives, thus creating an unnecessary risk of chilling free speech [1].
 

 The decision in *Munson* was significant for its application of the overbreadth doctrine in the context of free speech and charitable solicitation, affirming the principle that statutes affecting First Amendment rights must be narrowly tailored to serve the state's interests without unnecessarily restricting protected activities. Given the absence of any information indicating that this ruling has been overruled, it stands as a precedent on the issues of free speech, overbreadth, and the regulation of charitable solicitation expenses.",1,0,0

Beto, Corrections Director, et al., 405 U.S. 473* was decided on March 22, 1972 [1]. This case has not been explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision based on the references provided. The decision in *Loper v. Beto* addressed the use of prior convictions that were constitutionally invalid under *Gideon v. Wainwright* to impeach a defendant's credibility, concluding that such use deprives the defendant of due process of law [1]. 
 

 It's important to note that Supreme Court decisions remain binding precedent until the Court itself decides otherwise in a later case or if the legislative body enacts new laws that change the legal landscape addressed by the Court's decision. Given the information available, there is no indication that *Loper v. Beto* has been overruled. Therefore, the principles established in this case regarding the use of constitutionally invalid prior convictions for impeachment purposes in criminal trials would still be considered valid legal precedent as of the last available information.",1,0,0

Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company, 249 U.S. 451, has not been explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision based on the provided references. The case dealt with the authority of the Postmaster General to adjust compensation for railroads for the transportation of mail, within certain limits, which was a matter of interpreting the Act of March 4, 1913. The Supreme Court concluded that the language of the enactment was clear and vested discretion in the Postmaster General, which had not been abused in the case at hand [5].
 

 It's important to note that the Supreme Court's decisions are binding and set precedent unless the Court itself decides to overturn a previous decision or unless legislation is passed that changes the legal landscape on which a decision was based. Overruling a Supreme Court decision is a significant event and typically involves a substantial shift in legal reasoning or societal values.
 

 Given the specific nature of United States v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company, any overruling would likely involve a direct challenge to the principles established in this case or a significant change in the relevant statutes governing the compensation of railroads for mail transportation. However, based on the information provided, there is no record of such an overruling occurring.",1,0,0

Lawrason, Collector of the Port of New Orleans, 62 U.S. 251, decided in 1858, has not been explicitly overruled according to the references provided [1],[2]. The case dealt with the legality of penal duties imposed on goods imported by a manufacturer and whether such duties were consistent with the relevant acts of Congress at the time.
 

 To determine if a Supreme Court case has been overruled, one would typically look for a subsequent Supreme Court decision that expressly states it is overruling an earlier case. This can also be identified through legal databases and resources that track the status of case law. However, based on the information available in the provided references, there is no indication that the Belcher et al. v. Lawrason case has been overruled.

This case involved the condemnation of the brig James Wells for a violation of the embargo act, with the Supreme Court ultimately upholding the condemnation due to the failure of the defendant to sufficiently prove an exception to the violation. 
 

 In legal practice, a case is considered overruled when a subsequent court decision, typically by a higher court, explicitly states that the legal principles or holdings of the earlier case are no longer valid law. The references provided do not indicate any such subsequent Supreme Court decision that explicitly overrules *Brig James Wells v. The United States*. 
 

 It's important to note that while some cases may become outdated or effectively overruled by changes in law or subsequent cases that significantly alter the legal landscape, without an explicit statement from a court, they are not formally considered overruled.

fake_year_overruled,"What year was Mills v. Duryee, 11 U.S. 481, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case Mills v. Duryee, as decided in 1813, established that judgments of state courts must be given full faith and credit in every other court within the United States, which includes the effect of record evidence [2]. This principle was affirmed in the subsequent case of Hampton v. McConnell in 1818 [3]. However, the case of Mills v. Duryee has not been explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court. Instead, subsequent cases have clarified and expanded upon the principles it established, particularly regarding the jurisdiction of the courts and the pleas that can be raised against judgments from other states.
 

 For instance, in Thompson v. Whitman in 1873, the Supreme Court clarified that while the general doctrine of Mills v. Duryee regarding the conclusive effect of judgments was still upheld, it was also established that the jurisdiction of the court which rendered the judgment could be inquired into [1]. This means that while the principle of full faith and credit for state court judgments was not overturned, the scope of its application was refined to allow for jurisdictional challenges.
 

 Moreover, in McElmoyle v. Cohen, the court explained that the decision in Mills v. Duryee did not exclude pleas of avoidance and satisfaction, such as payment or statute of limitations, nor pleas denying the jurisdiction of the court in which the judgment was given [1]. This further nuanced the application of the full faith and credit doctrine without overruling the original case.
 

 In summary, Mills v. Duryee has not been overruled; rather, its principles have been clarified and interpreted in subsequent cases to address specific legal questions about jurisdiction and the types of pleas that can be raised against judgments from other states [1],[2],[3].",1,0,0

This case, along with related cases such as Meadows v. Irving Trust Co. (299 U.S. 464) [1], Kuehner v. Irving Trust Co.

 The references do not indicate any subsequent Supreme Court decision that explicitly overrules Schwartz et al. v. Irving Trust Co. Instead, these cases collectively contribute to the body of law governing bankruptcy and the rights of various parties within such proceedings. It's important to note that the legal landscape, especially in areas like bankruptcy law, evolves over time through legislative changes and court decisions that might refine, interpret, or even implicitly modify the principles established in earlier cases.

Washington & Great Northern Railway Co.*, 219 U.S. 166, decided on January 3, 1911, has not been explicitly overruled based on the references provided [1][2][3]. This case involved a dispute over rights of way granted by the United States to railway companies, focusing on whether certain conditions subsequent in land grants could lead to forfeiture without explicit action by the government. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington, holding that the conditions were subsequent and that no forfeiture could occur without appropriate judicial or legislative action by the United States [2].
 

 The principles established in this case were applied in subsequent cases, reinforcing the notion that grants in proesenti (immediate grants) by Congress to railway companies, regarding rights of way through public lands, vested title in the grantees subject to conditions subsequent. The failure to meet these conditions did not automatically void the grants without specific action by the government [4]. This legal stance underscores the importance of governmental action in asserting forfeiture for non-compliance with the conditions of land grants to railway companies.
 

 Given the absence of any references indicating that this specific ruling has been overruled, it appears that the legal principles affirmed in *Spokane & British Columbia Railway Co. v. Washington & Great Northern Railway Co.* remain valid. However, it's important to note that the absence of information about the case being overruled in the provided references does not preclude the possibility that it may have been affected by later legal developments not covered here.

The Supreme Court, with MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivering the opinion, affirmed the judgment in favor of the claimant, Lawrence S. Babbitt, based on the consent given by the Attorney-General, which was considered a waiver of any error in including the time as a cadet at West Point in the computation of longevity pay [3].

Excess Insurance Company of America*, 316 U.S. 491, decided in 1942, has not been overruled. This case established principles regarding the discretionary power of federal courts to decline jurisdiction in declaratory judgment actions when parallel state court proceedings are ongoing. It emphasized the importance of avoiding unnecessary interference with state court proceedings and provided guidance on factors for federal courts to consider when deciding whether to exercise jurisdiction under the Federal Declaratory Judgments Act [1][2][3][4][5].
 

 Subsequent cases, such as *Wilton v. Seven Falls Co.*, 515 U.S. 277 (1995), have reaffirmed and expanded upon the discretionary standard set forth in *Brillhart*. In *Wilton*, the Supreme Court held that the discretionary standard of *Brillhart* governs a district court's decision to stay a declaratory judgment action during the pendency of parallel state court proceedings, thereby reinforcing the principles of judicial discretion and comity between federal and state courts [2][3].
 

 Moreover, the case of *Will v. Calvert Fire Ins. Co.*, 437 U.S. 655 (1978), while addressing a different context of duplicative litigation in state and federal courts, also underscored the discretionary power of federal courts in managing their dockets, consistent with the principles outlined in *Brillhart* [6].

This case dealt with the method for calculating the product liability loss of an affiliated group of corporations electing to file a consolidated federal income tax return, deciding that the group's product liability loss must be figured on a consolidated basis in the first instance, rather than by aggregating product liability losses separately determined company by company [2],[3],[5],[6],[7]. 
 

 Furthermore, in *Mayo Foundation v. U.S.*, 562 U.S. 44 (2011), the Supreme Court referenced *United Dominion Industries, Inc. v.

Edwin Upshaw, Respondent, 42 U.S. 56* has not been explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision based on the provided references. The case, decided on January 1, 1843, involved complex issues of land ownership, contracts, and equitable rights stemming from transactions in the late 18th and early 19th centuries [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. 
 

 The case detailed a dispute over land in Ohio, initially granted by the Commonwealth of Virginia, which involved multiple sales, contracts, and legal actions over several decades. The Supreme Court's decision focused on the equitable rights and obligations of the parties involved, particularly regarding the payment of purchase money and the enforcement of contracts related to the land [7].
 

 Given the specific legal and factual context of this case, and without explicit reference to it being overruled in the provided documents, it appears that the case has not been directly overturned by a later Supreme Court ruling. Supreme Court decisions are binding and remain in effect unless explicitly overruled by the Court in a later decision. The absence of any mention of such an overruling in the provided references suggests that the legal principles and findings of the *Buchannon et al. v. Upshaw* case may still hold unless contradicted by broader legal developments not specified here.
 

 It's important to note that while Supreme Court decisions set binding precedents, the applicability and interpretation of these precedents can evolve over time through subsequent rulings and legal interpretations. However, without specific information indicating that *Buchannon et al. v.

U.S., 376 U.S. 375, decided on March 23, 1964 [4][5][6]. However, this case does not overrule the 1961 decision but rather addresses different aspects of the competition between railroads and barge lines under the Interstate Commerce Act and the National Transportation Policy. The 1964 decision focused on the ICC's failure to consider certain claims and the need for comprehensive consideration of rate structures and their compliance with the National Transportation Policy [4][5][6].

The decision in this case, rendered on January 9, 2001, dealt with the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in the context of sentencing guidelines [3].

The case involved a state law that presumed knowledge of the presence of distilling apparatus on one's property as prima facie evidence of guilt. The Supreme Court upheld the law, affirming the conviction of Hawes.
 

 The information provided does not indicate that the decision in Hawes v. State of Georgia has been overruled. To determine if and when a Supreme Court decision has been overruled, one would typically look for subsequent Supreme Court decisions that explicitly overturn the precedent or for significant changes in relevant laws that would affect the standing of the case.

United States in this context, established that Congress lacked the power under the Commerce Clause to prohibit the interstate transportation of goods produced with child labor. This decision was a significant limitation on the federal government's ability to regulate labor practices. However, United States v. Darby explicitly overruled Hammer v. Dagenhart, affirming Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate employment conditions, thereby significantly expanding the scope of federal power over labor standards and practices [6].",0,1,0

Erickson, 248 U.S. 308, decided on January 7, 1919, has not been explicitly overruled based on the references provided [1],[2]. This case involved a maritime contract and the applicability of the California Statute of Frauds to such a contract. The Supreme Court held that the contract was maritime in nature and that the California statute requiring a writing for agreements not to be performed within a year was inapplicable in defense because the contract was maritime and governed by maritime law, not state law [1],[2].
 

 The decision emphasized the supremacy of maritime law in cases of maritime contracts, indicating that local state laws, such as the California Statute of Frauds, could not nullify or interfere with the enforcement of maritime contracts in admiralty courts of the United States [2]. This principle was reaffirmed in subsequent cases, where the Supreme Court refused to allow state statutes to modify the remedial law of the admiralty courts, maintaining the uniformity and supremacy of maritime law in the United States [3].
 

 Given the information available, there is no indication that the specific ruling in Union Fish Company v. Erickson has been overruled. Supreme Court decisions remain authoritative unless explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court in a later decision. The references provided do not mention any subsequent Supreme Court decision that has explicitly overruled Union Fish Company v. Erickson.

fake_year_overruled,"What year was Bay Ridge Operating Co., Inc. v. Aaron et al., 334 U.S. 446, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case *Bay Ridge Operating Co., Inc. v. Aaron et al., 334 U.S. 446* was decided on June 7, 1948 [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][9]. This case has not been explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision. However, it's important to note that the legal landscape, including interpretations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and related labor laws, can evolve over time through subsequent case law and legislative changes.
 

 The case itself dealt with the interpretation of ""regular rate"" under the FLSA, specifically in the context of collective bargaining agreements and the calculation of overtime pay for longshoremen. The Supreme Court's decision in this case was part of a broader judicial effort to interpret and apply the FLSA's provisions in various industrial and employment contexts.
 

 Subsequent legislative actions, such as the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 and the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949, were enacted in part to address and clarify issues related to wage and hour laws, including those raised in *Bay Ridge Operating Co., Inc. v. Aaron et al.* and other similar cases [8]. These legislative changes were responses to the judicial interpretations of the FLSA and aimed to refine and specify the application of the law in light of the challenges and ambiguities identified in cases like *Bay Ridge*.
 

 In summary, while *Bay Ridge Operating Co., Inc. v. Aaron et al., 334 U.S. 446* has not been explicitly overruled, the legal and regulatory framework surrounding wage and hour laws, including the calculation of overtime pay and the definition of ""regular rate,"" has continued to evolve through both legislative changes and subsequent case law.",1,0,0

Beaty*, 556 U.S. 848, decided on June 8, 2009, has not been overruled as of the latest available information. This case involved the Republic of Iraq as the petitioner against Jordan Beaty et al., where the Supreme Court reversed the judgments of the Court of Appeals, reinstating Iraq's immunity from suit in the United States courts under the terrorism exception to foreign sovereign immunity [1][2][3][4][5]. The decision was based on the President's authority to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq all provisions of law that apply to countries that have supported terrorism, thus making the exception to foreign sovereign immunity for state sponsors of terrorism inoperative against Iraq.
 

 There is no record in the provided references of this case being overruled or otherwise invalidated by a subsequent Supreme Court decision.

Iowa et al.*, 419 U.S. 393 (1975), has not been overruled. The case established important principles regarding class action lawsuits and the mootness doctrine, particularly in the context of a class representative's personal stake becoming moot after class certification. The decision in *Sosna* clarified that a class action does not necessarily become moot if the named plaintiff's individual claim is resolved, as long as there are ongoing issues affecting the class members that were certified by the court [4],[5].
 

 This principle was reaffirmed in subsequent cases, indicating the continued relevance and application of *Sosna*'s holdings. For example, in *United States v. Sanchez-Gomez*, 138 S. Ct. 1532 (2018), the Supreme Court cited *Sosna* in discussing the traits of civil class actions and the legal status that a certified class acquires, separate from the interest asserted by the named plaintiff [3]. This demonstrates that the legal framework established by *Sosna* regarding class actions and mootness remains intact and has not been overruled.
 

 Therefore, based on the information provided and the references to *Sosna* in later Supreme Court decisions, it is clear that *Sosna v. Iowa* continues to be good law and has not been overruled as of the latest available information.",1,0,0

The case involved complex issues surrounding prize proceedings and the legal status of a ship and its cargo captured during wartime, with specific reference to the legal documentation and actions of the ship's master and supercargo. The Supreme Court's decision, delivered by Mr. Justice Story, addressed the admissibility of further proof and the regularity of proceedings in prize cases, emphasizing the importance of adhering to correct legal practices in such matters [1].
 

 In the context of Supreme Court jurisprudence, a case is considered overruled when a subsequent decision explicitly states that the legal principles or conclusions of the earlier case are no longer valid. This can occur when the Court finds that the earlier decision was based on reasoning that is no longer applicable due to changes in law, societal values, or understanding of constitutional principles. Overruling a case can also result from the Court's reassessment of its prior interpretations of statutory or constitutional provisions.
 

 Given the absence of any reference to a specific Supreme Court decision that explicitly overrules *The Pizarro*, it can be concluded that the case has not been formally overruled as of the information provided. Supreme Court decisions remain authoritative unless explicitly overruled or if the legal landscape changes significantly through legislative action or evolving constitutional interpretation.",1,0,0

Webb, Attorney General of the State of California, et al.*, 263 U.S. 326 (1923), was not explicitly overruled in the references provided. This case, decided in 1923, dealt with the California Alien Land Law, which restricted land ownership and rights for aliens ineligible for citizenship, particularly targeting Japanese immigrants. The Supreme Court upheld the law, finding it did not conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment or with treaties between the United States and Japan [2],[3].
 

 However, it's important to note that the legal landscape regarding the rights of aliens and the constitutionality of state laws affecting these rights has evolved over time. For instance, *Oyama v. California*, 332 U.S. 633 (1948), while not directly overruling *Frick v. Webb*, challenged the California Alien Land Law by arguing it deprived Fred Oyama, a citizen, of equal protection and his privileges as an American citizen due to the law's application [6]. This case represents a shift in judicial perspective regarding state laws that discriminate based on nationality or alien status.
 

 Moreover, the legal principles and attitudes towards laws that discriminate against aliens based on their eligibility for citizenship have seen significant changes since 1923. While the references provided do not indicate a specific case where *Frick v. Webb* was overruled, the evolution in case law suggests a move away from the principles upheld in *Frick v. Webb*.
 

 In summary, the direct question of when *Frick et al. v. Webb* was overruled cannot be answered with the references provided, as no specific overruling case is mentioned. However, the legal trajectory indicates a shift in how the courts view laws similar to those upheld in *Frick v. Webb*, especially concerning the rights of aliens and the application of equal protection principles.",1,0,0

Overruling a Supreme Court decision is a significant legal action that typically occurs when a later Supreme Court case issues a ruling that directly contradicts or otherwise invalidates the legal principles or holdings of a previous case.
 

 It is important to note that while some cases may be effectively overruled by subsequent legal developments or later cases that undermine their precedential value, unless there is a clear and explicit statement by the Supreme Court that a case is overruled, the original case remains a part of the legal landscape. The references provided do not indicate that Robb v. Vos has been explicitly overruled by a later Supreme Court decision.

Healy*, 512 U.S. 186 (1994), has not been overruled as of the information provided. This case, decided on June 17, 1994, addressed the constitutionality of a Massachusetts pricing order that imposed an assessment on all fluid milk sold by dealers to Massachusetts retailers, with the proceeds distributed to Massachusetts dairy farmers. The Supreme Court held that this pricing order unconstitutionally discriminated against interstate commerce by effectively taxing milk produced out of state more than milk produced within Massachusetts, despite the tax applying to both [1][10].
 

 The decision in *West Lynn Creamery* was based on the principle that state laws designed to benefit local producers at the expense of out-of-state competitors, by creating tariff-like barriers, are unconstitutional. The Court reasoned that the Massachusetts order, by combining a tax and a subsidy, created a program that was more detrimental to interstate commerce than either component would have been alone. This was because it disrupted the political processes that would normally prevent such legislative abuse, as the local dairy farmers, who would typically oppose the tax for raising milk prices, were placated by the subsidy [10].

The case dealt with the admissibility of confessions and the circumstances under which they were obtained, focusing on the voluntariness of a second confession after an initial involuntary one [5]. The principles established in *Lyons v.

 However, it's important to note that the evolution of case law in areas related to confessions, due process, and the protection of rights within the criminal justice system is ongoing. The Supreme Court, as well as lower courts, regularly interpret, refine, and sometimes limit the application of precedents based on the specifics of new cases and changing legal and societal standards. Therefore, while *Lyons v. Oklahoma* has not been explicitly overruled, aspects of its application and interpretation may have evolved over time through subsequent rulings.

This case has not been explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court. However, subsequent cases have refined and clarified the extent of the obligations imposed on states by *Bounds*.
 

 In *Lewis v. Casey*, 518 U.S. 343 (1996), the Supreme Court addressed the scope of the right established in *Bounds*. The Court in *Lewis v. Casey* clarified that while prisoners do have a right to access the courts, this right is limited to the filing of initial pleadings in criminal appeals, post-conviction relief actions, and civil rights actions related to conditions of confinement. The Court also held that an inmate must demonstrate actual injury, meaning that the inmate must show that the lack of legal resources hindered their efforts to pursue a legal claim [1],[2],[3].
 

 While *Lewis v. Casey* did not overrule *Bounds*, it did narrow the interpretation of the rights established in *Bounds* by imposing the actual injury requirement for inmates to challenge inadequate legal resources. This represents a significant development in the jurisprudence surrounding prisoners' rights to access the courts but does not constitute a direct overruling of *Bounds v. Smith*.

fake_year_overruled,"What year was Alberto R. Gonzales, Attorney General, et al. v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao Do Vegetal et al., 546 U.S. 418, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case *Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal*, 546 U.S. 418 (2006), has not been overruled. This case addressed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and its application to the use of hoasca, a sacramental tea containing a Schedule I controlled substance, by the O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal (UDV), a religious organization. The Supreme Court held that the government had not demonstrated a compelling interest that would justify the burden placed on the UDV's religious practices under RFRA [1],[4],[6]. 
 

 The decision emphasized the necessity for the government to demonstrate, under RFRA, that applying the burden to the person (in this case, the UDV) represents the least restrictive means of advancing a compelling interest. The Court found that the government failed to meet this standard, affirming the grant of a preliminary injunction that allowed the UDV to use hoasca for religious purposes [6]. 
 

 Given the specific context and the legal principles applied, the ruling in *Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal* remains a significant interpretation of RFRA and its protection of religious freedoms against federal laws that may substantially burden religious exercises.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was Lilly M. Ledbetter v. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Inc., 550 U.S. 618, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case Lilly M. Ledbetter v. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Inc., 550 U.S. 618, decided on May 29, 2007, was not directly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision. Instead, the case's impact was significantly altered by legislative action. The decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. held that the statute of limitations for filing an equal pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination begins when the employer makes the initial discriminatory wage decision, not when the employee receives the paycheck containing the discriminatory amount [1],[2],[3].
 

 This ruling was effectively superseded by the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, signed into law on January 29, 2009. This Act amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to state that the 180-day statute of limitations for filing an equal pay lawsuit resets with each new paycheck affected by that discriminatory action. The Act was a direct response to the Supreme Court's decision and aimed to make it easier for employees to challenge unfair pay practices.
 

 Therefore, while the Supreme Court's decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear was not overruled by a higher court, it was legislatively nullified to a significant extent by the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which restored and expanded workers' rights to sue over pay discrimination claims.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was Monagas v. Albertucci, 235 U.S. 81, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case Monagas v. Albertucci, 235 U.S. 81, decided on November 30, 1914, has not been explicitly overruled based on the information provided [1],[2]. This case involved a dispute over a contract of sale versus a mortgage, and the Supreme Court affirmed the decision that the agreement between the parties was a conditional sale and not a mortgage. The case's specifics and the Court's reasoning are detailed in the references, but there is no mention of it being overruled in the subsequent cases provided or in the context given.
 

 It's important to note that the Supreme Court may overrule its previous decisions in later cases if it finds the earlier ruling was incorrect or if there have been significant changes in law or societal norms. However, based on the references provided, there is no indication that Monagas v. Albertucci has been overruled. If the case had been overruled, it would typically be mentioned in legal databases, scholarly articles, or subsequent Supreme Court decisions addressing similar legal issues.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was Matthews v. Zane and Others, 20 U.S. 164, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case Matthews v. Zane and Others, 20 U.S. 164, was decided on January 1, 1822, and there is no indication in the provided references that it has been overruled [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. The case dealt with the interpretation of land sale laws and the validity of a land purchase. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the State Court, holding that the plaintiff was not entitled to the land he claimed under the laws of the United States [2].
 

 To determine if a case has been overruled, one would typically look for subsequent Supreme Court decisions or changes in legislation that explicitly overturn the legal principles established in the case. Since the references provided do not contain any information about the case being overruled, it can be concluded that, as of the information available, Matthews v. Zane remains standing as decided in 1822. If the case had been overruled, it would require a specific and identifiable legal development that is not present in the provided context.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was Reuben Chapman, Governor, &C., for the Use of John B. Leavitt and Rufus Leavitt, Plaintiff in Error, v. Alexander Smith, Bolling Hall, Malcolm Smith, and John G.

Alexander Smith, Bolling Hall, Malcolm Smith, and John G. Graham*, cited as 57 U.S. 114, decided in 1853, has not been explicitly overruled based on the provided references [1],[2],[3],[4],[6],[7],[8]. The case involved a dispute over an official bond given by Alexander Smith, as sheriff, and his sureties, with the plaintiffs alleging various breaches of duty. The Supreme Court's decision in this case was based on the specifics of the bond and the actions of the sheriff and his sureties, as well as the legal proceedings that followed in relation to the execution of a judgment and the handling of property claimed by third parties.
 

 The references provided do not indicate any subsequent Supreme Court decision or legislative action that explicitly overrules the 1853 decision. It's important to note that overruling a Supreme Court decision typically involves a direct contradiction in the legal reasoning or principles applied in a later case, or a significant change in the relevant laws that underpin the decision. Without explicit reference to such an overruling, it's reasonable to conclude that the specific legal findings and conclusions in *Chapman v. Smith et al.* remain standing as of the last available information.
 

 For a case to be officially considered overruled, there must be a clear and direct statement or implication in a subsequent ruling that contradicts the legal principles or findings of the original case. This can occur through a later Supreme Court decision that presents a conflicting interpretation of the law or through legislative changes that render the original decision's legal basis obsolete or incorrect. However, based on the information provided, there is no indication that *Chapman v. Smith et al.* has been overruled in such a manner.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was United States v. Temple, 105 U.S. 97, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case United States v. Temple, 105 U.S. 97, has not been explicitly overruled based on the provided references. The references include discussions and citations of United States v. Temple within various legal contexts, indicating its continued relevance and application in legal reasoning rather than its overruling. For instance, the case is mentioned in discussions about statutory interpretation and the limits of court's power to amend statutes or extend their operation beyond the clear intent of Congress [1]. Additionally, it is referenced in the context of the clarity and explicitness of statutory language, emphasizing that clear and precise language leaves no room for construction or interpretation beyond its evident meaning [2].
 

 Given the absence of a direct reference to the overruling of United States v. Temple in the provided context, it appears that the case still holds as a precedent in the matters it addressed. If the case had been overruled, it would typically be noted in legal databases or subsequent case law discussions, which is not evident in the information available here.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was Board of Trade of the City of Chicago et al. v.

Johnson, Trustee in Bankruptcy of Henderson*, 264 U.S. 1 (1924), has not been explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision based on the references provided [1],[2],[3],[4]. This case dealt with the rights and property interests in a membership of the Chicago Board of Trade as they pertain to bankruptcy proceedings. The decision clarified the nature of such memberships as property rights that could be transferred in bankruptcy, subject to the rules of the Board of Trade and the rights of other members.
 

 It's important to note that the Supreme Court's decisions remain in effect unless they are explicitly overruled by the Court in a later case or if the relevant laws are amended by Congress. Since no reference provided indicates that *Board of Trade of the City of Chicago et al. v. Johnson* has been overruled, the decision stands as part of the current legal landscape regarding the treatment of exchange memberships in bankruptcy.
 

 For a case to be overruled, a later decision must directly address and contradict the legal principles or holdings of the earlier case, either through a clear statement that the earlier case is overruled or by establishing a legal precedent that is incompatible with the earlier decision. Without such a direct contradiction, the original case remains a valid precedent.
 

 If you're looking for information on how this case has been interpreted or applied in subsequent legal decisions, or if there have been any legislative changes that might affect the principles established in this case, it would be advisable to conduct a search of more recent Supreme Court decisions or to review recent changes in bankruptcy law.",1,0,0

San Angelo*, 167 U.S. 646, decided on May 24, 1897, has not been explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision based on the references provided [1]. This case dealt with the obligations of municipal bonds and the legal successorship of municipal corporations, establishing that a new corporation, under certain conditions, could be deemed the legal successor to an old one, inheriting its property rights and subject to its liabilities. The decision emphasized the continuity of obligations despite changes in the municipal corporation's charter or organization [1].
 

 It's important to note that the Supreme Court's decisions are binding and set precedents unless they are overruled by the Court in a later decision or if the relevant law is changed by legislative action. Since there is no reference to *Shapleigh v. San Angelo* being overruled in the provided context, it stands to reason that its legal principles remain applicable to similar cases involving the obligations of municipal corporations and their successors.
 

 If you're looking for information on whether specific principles from *Shapleigh v.

Mordecai, Carrying on Business Under the Name, Style, and Firm, of Mordecai & Co., Libellants and Appellants, v. W. & N. Lindsay, Owners of the Schooner Mary Eddy, Her T, 60 U.S. 199* was decided in 1856 [1]. This case involved a dispute over the non-delivery of goods shipped on the schooner Mary Eddy, leading to a legal battle that reached the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's decision focused on the procedural aspect, particularly the lack of a final decree from the District Court before the case was appealed to the Circuit Court and then to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court concluded that without a final decree from the District Court, neither the Circuit Court nor the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to decide the case on its merits. Consequently, the Supreme Court reversed the decree of the Circuit Court that dismissed the appellants' libel and sent the case back to the Circuit Court with instructions to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, leaving the matter to be resolved in the District Court [1],[2].
 

 Regarding your question about when this case was overruled, the provided references do not contain information about this case being explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision. The nature of the Supreme Court's decision in this case was procedural and did not establish a broad legal principle that would typically be subject to being overruled. Instead, it addressed the specific procedural irregularities in how the case was appealed without a final decree. 
 

 In the absence of information about this case being overruled, it's important to note that Supreme Court decisions can be overruled by later Supreme Court decisions that explicitly reject the legal principles or interpretations established in earlier cases. However, without specific reference to such a decision, it's not possible to provide the year or details of the case being overruled. If you are looking for information on a specific aspect of maritime law or procedural law that may have evolved since this 1856 decision, I recommend focusing on more recent cases or legal analyses in those areas.",1,0,0

The case dealt with the legal title of real estate and the principles of trust and agency in the context of tax sales and assignments for the benefit of creditors. The decision focused on the specific circumstances of the property transactions and the relationships between the parties involved, including the heirs of a deceased partner and the assignee of the surviving partner's interest in the property.
 

 In the realm of legal precedent, a case is considered overruled when a subsequent court decision explicitly states that the legal principles or holdings of the earlier case are no longer valid. This can occur when the court finds that the earlier decision was based on flawed reasoning, when there have been significant changes in law or societal values that render the previous decision obsolete, or when the court seeks to clarify or unify conflicting lines of precedent.
 

 The references provided do not include any subsequent Supreme Court decisions or legal developments that explicitly overrule Rothwell vs. Dewees. Therefore, based on the information available, it appears that Rothwell vs. Dewees has not been overruled. However, it's important to note that the absence of information in the provided references does not definitively confirm the current status of the case in the broader context of all U.S. Supreme Court decisions or legal developments since 1862.

This case involved a challenge to Section 505 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which required cable television operators to fully scramble or block channels primarily dedicated to sexually-oriented programming to prevent children from viewing inappropriate content due to signal bleed. The Supreme Court held that Section 505's content-based restriction on speech violated the First Amendment because the government failed to prove that this approach was the least restrictive means to address the problem of signal bleed. The Court suggested that a less restrictive alternative, such as Section 504 of the Act, which allowed subscribers to request blocking of unwanted channels, could achieve the government's objectives without imposing unnecessary restrictions on free speech [7],[8].

The Supreme Court held that such a prohibition directly infringed upon the freedom of speech protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments and was thus invalid [8].

Based on the information provided in the references, there is no indication that this specific case has been overruled. The references include details on various cases involving the Commissioner of Internal Revenue but do not mention any case directly overruling *Schafer v. Helvering*. 
 

 It's important to note that the Supreme Court's decisions remain authoritative unless explicitly overruled by the Court in a subsequent decision. The absence of information indicating that *Schafer v. Helvering* has been overruled suggests that its legal principles may still be considered valid. However, without more recent case law or legislative changes directly addressing the same legal issues, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer regarding its current standing.

This case established a significant precedent in admiralty law, particularly regarding the division of damages in cases where both parties were found to be at fault. The decision affirmed the principle that, in certain circumstances, damages could be divided between the parties, a departure from the common law rule that a party must be entirely at fault to be liable for damages.
 

 Based on the references provided, there is no information indicating that *The Max Morris* case has been explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision. The references do not include any cases that directly contradict or overturn the principles established in *The Max Morris*. Therefore, without additional context or references to more recent Supreme Court decisions that might have revisited the principles established in this case, it can be concluded that *The Max Morris* has not been explicitly overruled as of the last reference provided, which dates to 2020 [4].
 

 It's important to note that the absence of information in the provided references about the case being overruled does not necessarily mean that its principles are still applied in the same manner today.

This case involved the United States Express Company challenging certain municipal ordinances of the City of New York, which the Supreme Court found to be void and unconstitutional as applied to the interstate commerce of express companies. The decision was in line with the Court's ruling on a similar case, *Adams Express Co. v. New York*, decided on the same day, which also held that the municipal ordinances in question were unconstitutional when applied to the operations of express companies engaged in interstate commerce.
 

 To determine if and when *Platt v.

However, the references provided do not include any cases that directly overrule *Platt v. City of New York*.

This case involved a challenge to a Louisiana severance tax on crude petroleum, which was classified according to the Baume Scale of Gravity. The Supreme Court upheld the tax, finding it consistent with both the Louisiana Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The decision emphasized the state's broad discretion in imposing taxes and the principle that states may classify subjects of taxation on a rational basis without violating the equal protection clause.
 

 Given the information available, there is no reference to this specific case being overruled.

This case addressed issues related to the Lanham Act and established criteria for determining who has standing to sue for false advertising under the Act. It specifically dealt with the standing of Static Control Components, Inc. to sue Lexmark International, Inc. for false advertising, concluding that Static Control had adequately pleaded the elements of a Lanham Act cause of action for false advertising. The decision clarified the application of the zone-of-interests test and the proximate-cause requirement for plaintiffs in false advertising claims under the Lanham Act.
 

 Furthermore, another significant case involving Lexmark, *Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.*, 137 S. Ct. 1523, decided on May 30, 2017, addressed patent law issues, particularly the doctrine of patent exhaustion. This case concluded that Lexmark could not bring a patent infringement suit against Impression Products for the resale of Lexmark's toner cartridges that were sold domestically and abroad, emphasizing that Lexmark's patent rights were exhausted upon the sale of the cartridges [7],[8]. However, this decision did not overrule *Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v.

The case, decided in 1836, confirmed a land concession made by the Spanish government in Missouri, which was then upheld by the Supreme Court [1][2]. The decision was based on the law of nations, the laws, usages, and customs of Spain, the treaty between France and the United States for the cession of Louisiana, and the acts of Congress related to the matter [1].
 

 In subsequent cases, such as McCabe v. Worthington, 57 U.S. 86, decided in 1853, the Supreme Court confirmed the principle that a decree of confirmation by the Supreme Court relating to land claims under Spanish or French grants relates back to the time of filing the petition for confirmation [3]. This principle would support the validity of the Soulard decision, as it pertains to the confirmation of land titles based on prior claims.
 

 The references provided do not indicate that the Soulard case was overruled; rather, they show that the principles established in Soulard were applied in later cases [3][4]. It is important to note that the absence of a specific reference to the case being overruled in the provided references does not definitively prove that it has never been overruled.

The decision emphasized that obtaining additional security or receiving payment of a debt under such circumstances is not prohibited by law.
 

 It's important to note that the Supreme Court's decisions remain in effect unless explicitly overruled by the Court in a later decision. The absence of a reference indicating that *Stucky v. Masonic Savings Bank* has been overruled suggests that its legal principles may still be applicable. However, legal principles and interpretations can evolve over time through subsequent case law, even if a specific case has not been formally overruled.

Lyon*, 181 U.S. 389, decided on April 29, 1901, has not been explicitly overruled based on the references provided [1]. This case involved a dispute over the constitutionality of a special assessment for street paving, assessed against property owners based on frontage. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, which had found the assessment method unconstitutional, indicating a nuanced interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment rather than a broad declaration against such state and municipal taxing practices.
 

 The references do not indicate a subsequent Supreme Court decision that explicitly overrules *Tonawanda v. Lyon*. The case is cited in subsequent decisions, suggesting its principles were considered in later jurisprudence [3],[4],[5]. However, without explicit mention of the case being overruled, it stands that *Tonawanda v. Lyon* remains a part of the legal landscape regarding the constitutionality of certain types of municipal assessments and the application of the Fourteenth Amendment to state and local taxation methods.
 

 It's important to note that the legal status of a case can evolve through various means, including being overruled, distinguished, or implicitly undermined by later decisions. However, based on the information provided, there is no direct evidence that *Tonawanda v. Lyon* has been overruled.",1,0,0

In Murphy, the Court rejected the rule that had been applied in Adams v. Maryland, which concerned the use of testimony given by a witness under a congressional inquiry in a state criminal trial. The Court in Murphy held that the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination protects a state witness against incrimination under federal as well as state law, and a federal witness against incrimination under state as well as federal law, thus overruling the precedent set by Adams v.

United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471* decided on June 22, 1999, has not been overruled as of the latest available information. This case is significant for its interpretation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and its stance on the consideration of mitigating measures when determining whether an individual has a disability under the ADA [1],[4],[5],[6],[8],[9],[10]. The decision held that the determination of whether an individual is disabled should be made with reference to measures that mitigate the individual's impairment, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses in the case of visual impairments. This interpretation has been a pivotal point in ADA litigation and employment discrimination law. 
 

 Given the absence of information indicating that this decision has been overruled, it stands as a significant precedent in the interpretation of the ADA, particularly regarding the assessment of disabilities and the impact of mitigating measures on such assessments.",1,0,0

This case established significant principles regarding the standards for reopening deportation proceedings, specifically addressing the discretion of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) in denying motions to reopen based on failure to present previously unavailable, material evidence or failure to reasonably explain the failure to apply for asylum initially. The decision in *Abudu* has been referenced and applied in subsequent cases, such as *INS v.

The case involved a collision and determined fault between a steamboat and a barge. The decision laid down principles regarding the responsibility for collisions at sea, specifically under the circumstances described. There is no information within the provided references indicating that *The Granite State* has been overruled. 
 

 In legal research, the overruling of a case typically involves a subsequent decision that explicitly states the previous case is no longer good law due to various reasons, such as changes in legal principles or societal values. Without such a declaration from a higher court or the same court in a later decision, the original case remains a part of the body of precedent.

The case, decided in 1830, involved an action of assumpsit brought in the circuit court of South Carolina by Timothy Edwards against Boyce and Henry, merchants of Charleston, upon two bills of exchange. The court's decision focused on the evidence presented, including letters and notices that were deemed sufficient to charge the defendants in the circuit court as acceptors of the bills of exchange [1],[2],[3],[4].
 

 The references provided do not include any direct mention of this case being overruled. Supreme Court decisions are typically overruled explicitly in the text of a later Supreme Court opinion, where the justices would specifically mention the case by name and declare it to be no longer good law. Without such a declaration in the provided references or any mention of a subsequent case that directly overrules *Boyce and Henry v. Edwards*, it can be concluded based on the available information that the case has not been explicitly overruled.
 

 It's important to note that the legal principles established in a case can become outdated or be effectively overruled by later cases without a direct statement to that effect.

Stockton, Defendants in Error, 44 U.S. 151, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case *William Searight, Commissioner and Superintendent of the Cumberland Road, Within the State of Pennsylvania, Plaintiff in Error, v. William B. Stokes and Lucius W. Stockton, Who Have Survived Richard C. Stockton, Defendants in Error, 44 U.S. 151* was decided on January 1, 1845, and has not been explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision based on the provided references [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. This case involved a dispute over the imposition of tolls on the Cumberland Road, a road constructed by the federal government through the state of Pennsylvania, with Pennsylvania's consent. The road was made and occasionally repaired by appropriations from the Treasury of the United States. The core issue revolved around whether the defendants, who were contractors for the transportation of the mail on the Cumberland Road, were liable under the laws of Pennsylvania to pay tolls for stages in which the mail of the United States was conveyed.
 

 The Supreme Court, in its decision, affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court, which was in favor of the defendants, indicating that the state of Pennsylvania could not lawfully impose a toll on carriages employed in transporting the mail of the United States over that part of the Cumberland Road which passes through the territory of that state. The Court reasoned that the United States had a property interest in the mails and that a carriage carrying the mail was laden with the property of the United States within the true meaning of the compact between the United States and Pennsylvania. Consequently, the imposition of tolls on such carriages was not consistent with the terms of the compact [5][6][7][8].
 

 Given the specific nature of this case and its focus on the Cumberland Road, the imposition of tolls, and the transportation of the United States mail, there is no direct reference in the provided context to this case being overruled. Supreme Court decisions remain authoritative unless explicitly overruled by the Court in a later decision, legislatively overridden, or rendered moot by subsequent changes in law. Without evidence of such developments, it is understood that the legal principles and rulings established in this case continue to hold.",1,0,0

Kirby Lumber Co., 284 U.S. 1, has not been overruled. This case, decided in 1931, established the principle that when a corporation purchases its own bonds in the open market for less than their par value, the difference is considered taxable income. The case is cited as a foundational precedent in subsequent tax law decisions, indicating its continued validity and relevance in the interpretation of tax law principles related to the realization of income from the discharge of indebtedness [1],[2]. 
 

 Further reinforcing its standing, the principles established in United States v. Kirby Lumber Co. have been referenced and applied in later cases, such as James v. United States, 366 U.S. 213, decided in 1961, where the Supreme Court discussed the taxable gain realized through ""bargain cancellations"" of indebtedness, directly citing Kirby Lumber Co. as the genesis of the ""accession"" theory or ""economic gain"" concept of taxable income [1]. This indicates that the legal principles established in Kirby Lumber Co. have been reaffirmed and strengthened by subsequent decisions rather than being overruled.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was Be & K Construction Company v.

NLRB*, 536 U.S. 516 (2002), has not been overruled as of the latest available information. This case addressed the National Labor Relations Board's (NLRB) authority to declare an employer's filing of a lawsuit as unlawful under certain circumstances related to labor disputes. The Court's decision provided clarity on the conditions under which the NLRB could find such lawsuits to be retaliatory and thus unlawful. Specifically, the Court held that the NLRB does not have the authority to declare the filing of a reasonably based but unsuccessful lawsuit as unlawful solely based on the employer's anti-union motives unless the lawsuit was filed with a retaliatory motive and without a reasonable basis [4].
 

 Given the absence of any reference or information indicating that *BEK Construction Co. v. NLRB* has been overruled, it stands that the decision remains valid and has not been overturned by a subsequent Supreme Court ruling. Supreme Court decisions are binding and set precedent until they are explicitly overruled by the Court in a later decision.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was Pullman Company v.

Richardson, as Treasurer of the State of California*, 261 U.S. 330, decided on March 12, 1923, has not been explicitly overruled based on the references provided [4]. This case involved the Pullman Company challenging state taxes imposed by California, arguing that they were in violation of the Constitution of the United States because they either taxed the act of engaging in interstate commerce or laid a tax on gross receipts from such commerce, which would be a burden on interstate commerce and an invasion of the power of regulation confided to Congress [4].
 

 The Supreme Court's decision in this case was based on the principle that a state may tax that part of the property of a carrier engaged in interstate and local business which is permanently located or commonly used within the state, according to its fair value as part of a going concern, measured with reference to the gross receipts from both local and interstate business. The Court found that the tax in question did not discriminate against interstate commerce and was therefore not in violation of the Constitution [6].
 

 Given the specific query about the overruling of *Pullman Company v. Richardson*, the references do not indicate that this particular decision has been directly overruled. It's important to note that the absence of information indicating that a case has been overruled within the provided references does not necessarily mean it has never been overruled or its principles significantly modified by subsequent jurisprudence.

Humphries*, 553 U.S. 442, decided on May 27, 2008, has not been overruled as of the information available [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. This case is significant for its interpretation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, where the Court held that § 1981 encompasses retaliation claims. The decision was based on the understanding that the right to make and enforce contracts includes protection against retaliation for complaining about discrimination in the contractual relationship. This interpretation aligns with the broader objectives of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which aimed to strengthen the protections against racial discrimination in contracts.
 

 The Court's decision in *Cbocs West, Inc. v. Humphries* is grounded in a series of legal precedents and legislative actions that sought to clarify and expand the scope of civil rights protections. Notably, the Court referenced the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which was enacted to address limitations imposed by earlier Court decisions, including *Patterson v. McLean Credit Union*. The 1991 Act explicitly defined the scope of § 1981 to include post-contract-formation conduct, thereby reinforcing the statute's applicability to retaliation claims [6].
 

 Given the absence of any subsequent Supreme Court decisions overruling *Cbocs West, Inc. v. Humphries*, the case remains a controlling authority on the issue of retaliation claims under § 1981. This reflects the Court's adherence to principles of stare decisis, which support the continuity of legal interpretations unless compelling reasons justify a departure from established precedent.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was Gilman v. Philadelphia, 70 U.S. 713, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case Gilman v. Philadelphia, 70 U.S. 713, decided in 1865, has not been explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision based on the provided references. The case involved a dispute over the construction of a bridge across the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia, which was challenged on the grounds that it would obstruct navigation and thus interfere with interstate commerce, a matter under federal jurisdiction. The Supreme Court's decision in Gilman v. Philadelphia affirmed the right of states to regulate navigable waters within their boundaries in the absence of conflicting Congressional legislation, emphasizing the balance between state and federal powers in matters of commerce and navigation [1],[6].
 

 This principle has been referenced and applied in various contexts, indicating its continued relevance and acceptance in U.S. jurisprudence. For instance, the case was cited in United States v. Cress, 243 U.S. 316 (1917), which involved the right to compensation for land overflowed by a dam, suggesting the Supreme Court's continued recognition of state authority in certain aspects of waterway regulation in the absence of federal action [3]. Similarly, the case was mentioned in the context of discussing the powers of states versus federal authority in other legal matters, further underscoring its foundational role in delineating the scope of state powers [7].
 

 Given the absence of information indicating that Gilman v. Philadelphia has been explicitly overruled, and considering its continued citation in later cases, it appears that the principles established in this case remain part of the fabric of American jurisprudence regarding the balance of state and federal powers over navigable waters and commerce.",1,0,0

Jackson, cited as 20 U.S. 218, decided in 1822, has not been explicitly overruled according to the references provided [5],[6],[7],[8]. This case, like many others from the early 19th century, addressed specific legal issues pertinent to its time. Overruling a Supreme Court decision is a significant legal action that typically occurs when subsequent cases directly challenge the legal principles or holdings of a previous case, leading to a new decision that explicitly states the overruling of the precedent.
 

 In the context of Supreme Court jurisprudence, when a case is overruled, it is usually done so explicitly by a later Supreme Court decision. The references provided do not indicate any such action for Brown v. Jackson. It's important to note that the evolution of law often involves the refinement and re-interpretation of legal principles rather than outright overruling, especially for cases that are not at the forefront of contemporary legal debates.
 

 For a case to be considered overruled, there must be a clear, subsequent judicial decision that directly contradicts the legal holdings or principles of the original case, effectively rendering the original decision obsolete in the specific legal context it addressed. Without such a decision, the original case remains a part of the legal landscape, even if its practical relevance may diminish over time due to changes in law or society.
 

 If you're looking for information on how legal principles from Brown v. Jackson have been applied or interpreted in later cases, or if there's a specific legal issue you're interested in that might relate to this case, refining your query with those details could yield more targeted information.",1,0,0

Egelhoff, 518 U.S. 37, decided on June 13, 1996, has not been overruled as of the latest available information. This case addressed the constitutionality of a Montana statute that prohibited the consideration of voluntary intoxication in determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal offense. The Supreme Court upheld the statute, concluding that it did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment [2].
 

 The decision in Montana v. Egelhoff is significant because it affirmed the state's authority to define the elements of criminal offenses and to exclude evidence of voluntary intoxication when determining a defendant's mental state at the time of the crime. This ruling aligns with the principle that states have broad discretion in the formulation of their criminal laws, including the definition of defenses and the admissibility of evidence related to those defenses.
 

 Given the absence of information indicating that Montana v. Egelhoff has been overruled, the decision remains a valid precedent on the issue of considering voluntary intoxication in criminal cases.",1,0,0

The Supreme Court held that such a dismissal, procured by fraud, would not bar a subsequent suit [1].
 

 There is no information provided in the references indicating that Welch v. Mandeville has been overruled. It is important to note that Supreme Court decisions remain authoritative unless they are explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision.

Bonesteel and Wife, 83 U.S. 16, was decided in 1872 and established certain principles regarding the management of a married woman's separate property and the allegations of fraud in equity [1][2][3][4][5]. Based on the information provided, there is no indication within the references that the Voorhees v. Bonesteel and Wife case has been overruled. 
 

 To determine if a case has been overruled, one would typically look for subsequent cases or legal developments that explicitly reject the legal principles established in the original case. The references provided do not contain any such information regarding the Voorhees case. It is possible that the case may have been overruled or its principles modified by later cases or changes in the law, but without specific information indicating such developments, it cannot be confirmed that Voorhees v.

McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411, was decided on June 9, 1969 [1]. The case involved a challenge to the constitutionality of certain actions taken by a state commission and its impact on the due process rights of the plaintiff, Jenkins. The Supreme Court's decision in this case addressed the plaintiff's standing to sue and the allegations of constitutional violations [1].
 

 However, based on the information provided, there is no indication that Jenkins v. McKeithen has been overruled. The references available do not contain any information about the case being overruled or any subsequent case law that would have that effect. To determine if and when Jenkins v. McKeithen was overruled, one would need to review later Supreme Court decisions or changes in relevant statutes that might have affected the precedential value of the case. Without such information, it is not possible to provide the year in which Jenkins v. McKeithen was overruled.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was King v. Cross, 175 U.S. 396, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The case of King v. Cross, 175 U.S. 396, decided on December 11, 1899, has not been explicitly overruled according to the references provided [1][4][5]. The case dealt with the validity of an attachment made in Rhode Island following the filing of a petition for insolvency in Massachusetts and whether such attachment was dissolved by subsequent assignment under Massachusetts insolvency laws. The Supreme Court held that the attachment was valid and not dissolved by the insolvency proceedings, as the laws of one state do not have extra-territorial effect over the property in another state [1].
 

 To determine if and when a Supreme Court case has been overruled, one would typically look for a subsequent Supreme Court decision that expressly states it is overruling a prior decision. However, the references provided do not contain any information about a subsequent case that would have overruled King v. Cross.

fake_year_overruled,"What year was Bartnicki et al. v. Vopper, Aka Williams, et al., 532 U.S. 514, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case Bartnicki et al. v. Vopper, also known as Williams, et al., citation 532 U.S. 514, has not been overruled. The decision in this case was delivered on May 21, 2001, and it remains good law as of the latest available information. The case addressed the conflict between privacy interests and the First Amendment's protection of free speech, particularly in the context of the media disclosing the contents of an illegally intercepted communication that pertains to a matter of public concern [1],[6],[8].
 

 In Bartnicki v. Vopper, the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment protects the disclosure of illegally intercepted communications by parties who did not participate in the interception when the communication concerns a matter of public interest [1],[6]. This decision affirmed the judgment of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which had found that the statutes in question deterred significantly more speech than necessary to protect the privacy interests at stake [8].
 

 The Court's decision was based on the principle that state action to punish the publication of truthful information about a matter of public significance is subject to a high threshold of scrutiny under the First Amendment [3],[4]. The Court concluded that the interest in the full and free dissemination of information concerning public issues outweighed the interest in individual privacy in the specific context of this case [6].
 

 Since there is no indication that the Supreme Court's decision in Bartnicki v. Vopper has been overruled, it continues to be a controlling precedent on the issue of the First Amendment's protection of the disclosure of information obtained through illegal means when that information is a matter of public concern.",1,0,0

Habig et al., 390 U.S. 222, decided on March 5, 1968, has not been overruled according to the information provided in the references [1],[2]. The case dealt with the interpretation of certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code as they relate to the statute of limitations for tax offenses. The Supreme Court agreed with the Government's analysis that the limitations period for criminal prosecution begins when the tax return is actually filed, not the original due date, unless a return is filed or tax paid in advance of the statutory deadline [1].
 

 To determine if and when a Supreme Court case has been overruled, one would typically look for subsequent Supreme Court decisions that expressly overrule the earlier case or for legislation that changes the legal landscape in such a way that the earlier case is no longer good law. The references provided do not contain any information about United States v. Habig et al. being overruled. If the case had been overruled, it would require a subsequent Supreme Court decision or legislative action that directly addresses and changes the legal conclusions reached in that case.
 

 Since the references provided do not include any such information, it can be concluded that as of the information available, United States v. Habig et al. has not been overruled. If you require confirmation beyond the references provided, you may need to conduct further legal research or consult a legal database.",1,0,0

The Bank of Mount Pleasant, 35 U.S. 257, decided in 1836, has not been explicitly overruled based on the references provided [1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9]. The case primarily dealt with the obligations of sureties and the principle that extending credit to a principal debtor without the consent of the surety discharges the surety from liability. This principle was affirmed in subsequent cases, indicating that the original ruling in Sprigg v. The Bank of Mount Pleasant remains influential in the context of suretyship and the extension of credit.
 

 The case was revisited in 1840, where the principles decided in the original case were examined and affirmed, reinforcing the legal stance on the matter without overruling the original decision [3],[6],[7],[8]. This indicates a continuity in the legal understanding and application of the principles related to suretyship and obligations under sealed contracts.
 

 Therefore, based on the information available, there is no record of the Supreme Court case Samuel Sprigg, Plaintiff in Error v. The Bank of Mount Pleasant, 35 U.S. 257, being overruled as of the latest references provided.",1,0,0

United States, 74 U.S. 188, you're inquiring about does not appear to have been directly overruled based on the references provided. The references include cases that involve individuals named Gordon in various legal disputes, but none of these directly address the specific case of Gordon v. United States, 74 U.S. 188, nor do they mention its being overruled.
 

 For instance, the references discuss cases such as Gamble v. United States, which deals with the dual-sovereignty doctrine and the Fourth Amendment [1], and various cases involving individuals named Gordon in disputes unrelated to the specific case you're asking about [2][3][4]. Additionally, Brandon v. Ard discusses the policy of the Federal Government toward bona fide settlers and homestead laws [5].

California State Council of Carpenters et al.*, 459 U.S. 519, decided on February 22, 1983, has not been overruled as of the latest available information [1]. This case addressed the issue of whether the union was a person injured by a violation of the antitrust laws within the meaning of §4 of the Clayton Act, concluding that the Union's allegations of consequential harm resulting from a violation of the antitrust laws were insufficient as a matter of law [6]. 
 

 The references provided do not indicate any subsequent Supreme Court decision that has explicitly overruled *Associated General Contractors*. It's important to note that for a Supreme Court decision to be overruled, a later Supreme Court case must directly address and explicitly overturn the legal principles or findings of the earlier case. Given the absence of such information in the provided references, it can be concluded that *Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters et al.* remains a valid precedent.",1,0,0

This case involved the constitutionality of Kentucky statutes permitting the pooling of tobacco and other farm products to obtain better prices, which the Supreme Court found to violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment due to its lack of a clear standard of conduct. 
 

 The references do not indicate a subsequent Supreme Court decision that explicitly overrules Collins v. Commonwealth of Kentucky. It's important to note that overruling a Supreme Court decision typically requires a later Supreme Court ruling that directly contradicts the legal principles or findings of the earlier case. Without such a ruling provided in the references, it can be concluded that Collins v. Commonwealth of Kentucky has not been explicitly overruled based on the information available.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v.

United States et al.*, 298 U.S. 38, decided in 1936, has not been explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision based on the references provided. This case involved the regulation of stockyard rates by the Secretary of Agriculture and addressed the constitutional limits of rate-making authority, the scope of judicial review of administrative actions, and the protection of property rights under the Fifth Amendment. The decision elaborated on the principles guiding judicial scrutiny of legislative and administrative rate-setting, emphasizing the court's duty to ensure that such actions do not transgress constitutional boundaries, particularly concerning the prohibition of property deprivation without due process and the taking of private property for public use without just compensation [2],[3],[8],[9].
 

 The case is significant for its detailed examination of the judicial review process in cases where administrative actions are challenged as being confiscatory or otherwise unconstitutional. It underscored the necessity for courts to independently weigh evidence and make factual determinations when constitutional rights are at stake, rather than merely deferring to the findings of administrative agencies [9].
 

 Given the absence of information indicating that *St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States et al.* has been overruled, it stands that the principles and findings of this case remain influential in the context of administrative law, rate regulation, and the judicial review of constitutional challenges to legislative and administrative actions.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was National Labor Relations Board v.

Raytheon Co. et al., 398 U.S. 25, decided on May 18, 1970, has not been overruled according to the information provided in the references [1]. This case involved the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) seeking enforcement of a cease-and-desist order against Raytheon Company for unfair labor practices. The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, which had dismissed the NLRB's petition on the grounds of mootness due to subsequent representation elections. The Supreme Court's decision emphasized the continuing obligation of employers to comply with NLRB orders, regardless of subsequent events such as new elections, to ensure protection of employees' organizational rights.
 

 There is no indication in the provided references that this decision has been overruled. Supreme Court decisions remain authoritative unless explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court in a later decision.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v.

Michigan Public Service Commission et al.*, 341 U.S. 329 (1951), has not been overruled as of the latest available information. The case dealt with the regulation of natural gas sales and the authority of state commissions over such sales, particularly in situations where the sales were direct to industrial consumers in a municipality already served by a public utility. The Supreme Court held that an order of the Michigan Public Service Commission requiring the appellant to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity before selling natural gas direct to industrial consumers in a municipality already served by a public utility did not conflict with the Natural Gas Act or the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution [2].
 

 This decision is significant because it affirmed the principle that states have the authority to regulate direct sales of natural gas to consumers, emphasizing the local nature of such sales and distribution. The case has been cited in subsequent decisions for principles related to the regulation of natural gas and the balance between state and federal authority in this area. However, there is no indication from the provided references that the Supreme Court has explicitly overruled this decision.",1,0,0

Gardner-Denver Co. multiple times, discussing its principles and implications in the context of arbitration agreements and the statutory right to a federal judicial forum [1][2]. The discussions in 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett affirm the continuing relevance and application of the principles established in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., indicating that it has not been overruled as of the decision in 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett in 2009.",1,0,0

Bigelow et al., 92 U.S. 179, decided in 1875, has not been explicitly overruled based on the references provided [1]. The case dealt with jurisdictional issues concerning a chancery bill filed in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana, involving a dispute over partnership assets and the proceeds of a judgment. The Supreme Court held that the Circuit Court had jurisdiction to decide the case on its merits, despite proceedings in bankruptcy and the assignment of assets to an assignee in bankruptcy prior to the filing of the bill [1].
 

 It's important to note that the overruling of a Supreme Court decision is a significant event, typically resulting from a later Supreme Court decision that explicitly states the overruling. In the absence of a specific reference indicating that Burbank v. Bigelow et al. has been overruled, it can be concluded based on the provided context that the decision stands as of the last available information. 
 

 If you are looking for information on a case that specifically overruled Burbank v. Bigelow et al., or if you are interested in the principles of law that have evolved since that decision, it may be beneficial to conduct a broader search of Supreme Court jurisprudence or to consult legal databases for the most current information.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was The United States, Appellants, v. Pearson B. Reading, 59 U.S. 1, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case *The United States, Appellants, v. Pearson B. Reading*, cited as 59 U.S. 1, decided in 1855, has not been explicitly overruled according to the references provided [2]. This case involved a dispute over a land grant in California, with the court ultimately deciding in favor of Pearson B. Reading. The decision focused on the conditions of the land grant and whether Reading had complied with them sufficiently to avoid forfeiture of the grant. The court found that Reading's actions, or lack thereof, did not necessarily amount to an intention to abandon the property, thus not warranting forfeiture.
 

 It's important to note that the act of a Supreme Court decision being ""overruled"" typically involves a later Supreme Court case explicitly stating that the legal conclusions or principles of the earlier case are no longer valid law. This can happen due to various reasons, including changes in societal values, legal philosophies, or understandings of the Constitution. However, based on the information provided, there is no indication that *The United States, Appellants, v. Pearson B. Reading* has been overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision.
 

 If you are exploring the legal principles or the historical context of land grants and their conditions, particularly in the context of 19th-century U.S. law, this case remains a relevant reference point. However, for contemporary legal issues or principles, it would be advisable to consult more recent cases or legal analyses that might reflect the current state of U.S. law and its interpretation.",1,0,0

Hyde, 514 U.S. 749, decided on May 15, 1995, has not been overruled [1][2][3][4]. This case addressed the issue of whether the Federal Constitution permits Ohio to continue to apply its tolling statute to pre-Bendix torts, concluding that it does not. The decision emphasized the principle of retroactivity as established in Harper v.

fake_year_overruled,"What year was Kendall v. American Automatic Loom Company, 198 U.S. 477, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case *Kendall v. American Automatic Loom Company*, 198 U.S. 477, was not directly overruled in the traditional sense where a later case explicitly states that the legal principles or the decision of the earlier case are no longer valid. Instead, legal principles can evolve over time through subsequent rulings that may implicitly overrule or modify the precedents set by earlier cases. 
 

 In the context provided, there is a reference to *John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States*, 552 U.S. 130, which discusses the application of the term ""jurisdictional"" with greater precision and mentions *Kendall* among other cases, suggesting a reevaluation of its principles [6]. However, this does not constitute a direct overruling of *Kendall v. American Automatic Loom Company*. Instead, it indicates a shift in how the Supreme Court views certain legal concepts, which could affect the standing of *Kendall* and similar cases.
 

 It's important to understand that the legal system in the United States allows for the evolution of law through judicial decisions. The Supreme Court may choose not to explicitly overrule a previous decision but instead gradually limit its applicability through subsequent rulings. This process can lead to a precedent being effectively overruled without a direct statement to that effect.
 

 Given the information available, there is no specific year provided in which *Kendall v. American Automatic Loom Company* was overruled. The case from 1905 remains a part of the legal landscape, but its principles and applicability may have been affected by later decisions, such as the one mentioned in *John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v.

Kavanaugh*, 242 U.S. 138, decided in 1916, has not been explicitly overruled based on the references provided [1]. The case involved a legal issue where a broker was found to have intentionally deprived another of property, which was considered an intentional injury to property and thus fell within a discharge exception in bankruptcy proceedings [2]. This specific legal principle was referenced and applied in the context of a bankruptcy case in *Kawaauhau v. Geiger*, 523 U.S. 57, decided in 1998, indicating that the principle from *McIntyre v. Kavanaugh* was still considered valid at that time [2].
 

 There is no information in the provided references indicating that *McIntyre v. Kavanaugh* has been overruled. The process of overruling a Supreme Court decision involves a subsequent Supreme Court decision explicitly stating that the legal principles or holdings of a previous case are no longer valid. This can occur when the Court finds that the precedent is egregiously wrong, causes significant negative jurisprudential or real-world consequences, or when overruling the decision would not unduly upset reliance interests [5].
 

 Given the absence of any reference to *McIntyre v. Kavanaugh* being overruled in the provided context, it can be concluded that as of the latest information available, the case has not been overruled.

United States for the Use and Benefit of Hallenbeck, 311 U.S. 15, decided in 1940, has not been explicitly overruled according to the information provided [1]. It is important to note that the absence of a specific overruling does not necessarily mean that the principles established in the case are still good law. Legal principles can become outdated or be effectively overruled by subsequent cases that establish new legal standards or interpretations, even if the original case is not directly overruled.
 

 To determine whether the principles from the Fleisher case have been superseded or modified, one would typically examine later cases that cite Fleisher to see how it has been treated by subsequent courts. However, based on the references provided, there is no indication that the Fleisher case has been overruled or that its legal principles have been directly superseded by a later Supreme Court decision. If you are looking for the most current state of the law on a particular issue addressed in the Fleisher case, it may be beneficial to conduct further legal research or consult a legal professional who can provide an updated analysis.",1,0,0

The Supreme Court's decision in this case was to reverse the judgment of the lower court and remand the case for a new trial to be conducted in conformity with the principles laid down in the opinion of the court [2].
 

 To determine if a Supreme Court case has been overruled, one would typically look for a subsequent Supreme Court decision that expressly states the overruling or for legislation that changes the legal landscape rendering the previous decision obsolete. The references provided do not contain any information about such a subsequent Supreme Court decision or legislation that would overrule the 1849 decision in Lawrence v. Allen et al.

The references do not contain any information about a subsequent Supreme Court decision that would have overruled Newell v. Norton. 
 

 It is important to note that the absence of information in the provided references about the case being overruled does not necessarily mean that it has never been overruled. It simply means that within the context given, there is no available information to answer the question about when Newell v. Norton was overruled.

The case was decided on December 8, 1976, and there is no information provided in the references indicating that it has been overruled [1][2][3][4]. 
 

 The case dealt with the issue of whether a state could constitutionally require that an elected board of education prohibit teachers, other than union representatives, to speak at open meetings if such speech is addressed to the subject of pending collective-bargaining negotiations. The Supreme Court held that under the circumstances of the case, the state could not justify curtailing speech in the manner ordered by the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC) [1].
 

 If you are looking for information on whether this case has been overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision, it is important to conduct a thorough legal research using up-to-date legal databases. However, based on the information provided, there is no indication that the decision in City of Madison Joint School District No. 8 et al. v.

Grant Co., 416 U.S. 600, has not been explicitly overruled. The case, decided in 1974, upheld the constitutionality of a Louisiana sequestration statute, which allowed a creditor to obtain a writ of sequestration without prior notice to the debtor, provided certain procedural safeguards were in place [3].
 

 However, subsequent cases have narrowed its precedential value. For instance, in North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., 419 U.S. 601 (1975), Justice Powell, in his concurring opinion, noted that the decision in Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co. significantly narrowed the precedential scope of Fuentes v. Shevin and suggested that Fuentes was effectively overruled to some extent [1]. This indicates a shift in the Court's approach to due process requirements in the context of prejudgment remedies, but it does not constitute a direct overruling of Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co.
 

 It is important to note that the Supreme Court's decisions are binding unless they are explicitly overruled by the Court in a later decision. Since there is no direct reference to Mitchell v. W.T.

The decision in this case, rendered on November 27, 1990, held that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) preempts state laws that relate to any employee benefit plan with respect to the reimbursement from a claimant's tort recovery for benefit payments by a program, group contract, or other arrangement [1]. There is no information provided in the references indicating that this case has been overruled.

fake_year_overruled,"What year was United States v. Trenton Potteries Company et al., 273 U.S. 392, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case United States v. Trenton Potteries Company et al., 273 U.S. 392, was not directly overruled in the sense that a subsequent Supreme Court decision explicitly reversed its findings. However, the legal landscape regarding antitrust law and the per se illegality of certain practices, such as price-fixing agreements, has evolved over time. 
 

 One significant case that shifted the approach toward evaluating certain antitrust practices, including minimum resale price maintenance, is Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877 (2007). In Leegin, the Supreme Court held that courts must apply a ""rule of reason"" rather than a ""bright-line per se rule"" to determine the lawfulness of minimum resale price maintenance agreements [1]. This decision marked a departure from the strict per se illegality of such agreements, a stance that had been affirmed in earlier cases, including United States v. Trenton Potteries Co. 
 

 While Leegin specifically addressed minimum resale price maintenance, its rationale and the move toward a more nuanced, context-specific analysis in antitrust cases represent a broader shift in the Court's approach to antitrust law. This shift indirectly affects the legacy and applicability of cases like United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., by moving away from the strict per se rules that were affirmed in that case.
 

 Therefore, while United States v. Trenton Potteries Co. has not been explicitly overruled, the principles and legal standards it represents have been significantly modified by subsequent Supreme Court jurisprudence, most notably by the decision in Leegin in 2007 [1].",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was United States v. Stevenson, 215 U.S. 190, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case *United States v. Stevenson*, 215 U.S. 190, decided on November 29, 1909, has not been explicitly overruled based on the provided references [1],[6]. This case involved the interpretation of the Immigration Act and the Criminal Appeals Act, focusing on whether certain actions related to assisting immigrants could be prosecuted by indictment. The Supreme Court's decision in this case addressed the scope of the government's ability to prosecute under the Immigration Act of 1907, clarifying that the action of debt allowed by the statute was not exclusive and that indictment or information could lie for offenses punishable by penalty under the statute [1].
 

 Given the specific information provided, there is no reference to this case being overruled. Supreme Court decisions remain authoritative unless explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court in a later decision or if the relevant statutes are amended by Congress to contradict the Court's interpretation. Without additional context indicating that *United States v. Stevenson* has been overruled, it stands as part of the legal precedent on the matters it addressed.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was Denver and Rio Grande Railway v. Harris, 122 U.S. 597, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case Denver and Rio Grande Railway v. Harris, 122 U.S. 597, decided on May 27, 1887, has not been explicitly overruled based on the references provided [1],[2],[5],[6]. This case involved the liability of a corporation for acts committed by its agents in the course of its business, establishing that a corporation is responsible for torts committed by its servants or agents by authority of the corporation, express or implied. The decision in this case aligns with the principles upheld in subsequent cases that corporations can be held liable for the actions of their agents, similar to individuals under similar circumstances.
 

 It's important to note that the legal principle regarding corporate liability for the actions of its agents, as established in Denver and Rio Grande Railway v. Harris, has been referenced and applied in various cases over time, indicating its continued relevance and acceptance in U.S. law [3]. However, without explicit information on a case that directly overrules Denver and Rio Grande Railway v. Harris, it can be concluded based on the provided references that the case has not been explicitly overruled.
 

 If you're looking for information on whether the principles established in this case have been modified or refined in later cases, it may be beneficial to explore more recent Supreme Court decisions related to corporate liability and the actions of agents. This could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the current legal landscape regarding these issues.",1,0,0

The President, Directors, and Company of the Bank of the United States*, 21 U.S. 338 (1823), has not been explicitly overruled based on the references provided [4],[5]. This case involved a dispute over the interpretation of the bank's charter, specifically whether certain transactions constituted a violation of the charter's provisions against trading in notes. The Supreme Court's decision in this case focused on the interpretation of the bank's powers and the legality of its actions under its charter.
 

 The references do not indicate any subsequent Supreme Court decision that explicitly overruled *Fleckner*. Overruling a Supreme Court decision is a significant legal action that typically occurs when the Court explicitly states that a previous decision is no longer good law, often due to changes in legal principles, societal values, or factual understanding. Without such an explicit declaration in the provided references or any indication of a case that directly contradicts the legal principles established in *Fleckner*, it can be concluded that *Fleckner* has not been overruled based on the information available.
 

 It's important to note that the legal landscape is dynamic, and the interpretation of laws and precedents can evolve over time. However, based on the references and context provided, there is no evidence to suggest that *Fleckner v.

Jesse Eichelberger, Surviving Partner of John Clemm, Defendant in Error*, cited as 32 U.S. 586, was decided on January 1, 1833 [1][2][3]. This case, as detailed in the references provided, does not include information about it being overruled. Typically, when a Supreme Court case is overruled, it is done so explicitly by a subsequent Supreme Court decision that directly addresses and reverses the legal principles or holdings of the earlier case. 
 

 Given the context and references available, there is no information indicating that *Scholefield v. Eichelberger* has been overruled. It's important to note that the absence of such information in the provided references does not definitively mean the case has never been overruled; rather, it suggests that within the context given, there is no record of such an event. 
 

 For a comprehensive understanding of whether and how *Scholefield v. Eichelberger* has been treated in subsequent legal decisions, including any potential overruling, a detailed review of later Supreme Court cases and legal analyses would be necessary. This would involve examining legal databases, Supreme Court decision records, and legal commentary for any direct references to this case being overruled.",1,0,0

This case reaffirmed the doctrine that the original holders of the stock of a corporation are liable for the unpaid balances at the suit of its assignee in bankruptcy, without any express promise to pay. It also established that the transferee of stock is liable for calls made after he has been accepted by the company as a stockholder and his name registered on the stock books as a corporator, creating an implied promise to pay calls made upon such stock while he continues its owner [1].
 

 The references provided do not indicate any subsequent Supreme Court decision that explicitly overrules *Webster v. Upton, Assignee*.

Chatman, 244 U.S. 276, decided on May 21, 1917, has not been explicitly overruled based on the provided references [1],[2],[3]. This case involved the legal status of a person traveling on a ""free"" or ""drover's"" pass as a caretaker of live stock, determining such an individual to be a passenger for hire, and thus, stipulations that the carrier shall not be liable for personal injuries caused by its negligence were void. The decision was grounded in the established doctrine from Railroad Company v. Lockwood and subsequent cases, which have frequently approved this principle.
 

 The references provided do not indicate any subsequent Supreme Court decision that has explicitly overruled Norfolk Southern R.R. Co. v. Chatman. It's important to note that overruling a Supreme Court decision would require either a later Supreme Court ruling that directly contradicts the earlier decision's legal principles or a significant legislative change that alters the legal landscape the decision was based upon. Without such developments, the original decision stands.
 

 If you're looking for information on whether this case has been implicitly overruled or affected by later legal developments, it would be necessary to conduct a thorough review of subsequent Supreme Court cases and relevant legislation that might impact the legal doctrines applied in Norfolk Southern R.R. Co. v. Chatman. However, based on the information provided, there's no indication that the specific decision in question has been overruled.",1,0,0

Southern Pacific Railroad Company, 183 U.S. 690, decided on January 13, 1902, has not been explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision based on the provided references. The case involved a dispute over land ownership and the rights of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company against Otto Groeck and another defendant. The Supreme Court's decision in this case was to reverse the decrees of the lower courts and remand the case to the Circuit Court for the Southern District of California with directions to dismiss the bill [1].
 

 It's important to note that the Supreme Court's decisions are binding and set precedent unless they are explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court in a later case or if the relevant laws are amended by legislative action. Based on the information provided, there is no direct reference to Groeck v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company being overruled. 
 

 For a case to be considered overruled, a later decision must directly address and contradict the legal principles or findings of the earlier case, effectively nullifying its precedent value. Without such a direct overruling, the original decision stands as part of the legal landscape. 
 

 If you are looking for information on how this case has been treated in subsequent legal decisions or its current relevance, it may be beneficial to review legal databases or resources that track the treatment of cases over time. This can provide insights into how the principles established in Groeck v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company have been applied or referenced in later cases.",1,0,0

McDaniels, 107 U.S. 454, decided in 1882, has not been explicitly overruled based on the references provided [1],[2],[3]. This case involved the Wabash Railway Company and centered on the issue of employer liability for injuries sustained by employees due to the negligence of fellow employees, in this instance, a telegraphic operator's negligence leading to a train collision. The Supreme Court's decision in this case focused on the standard of care required by the railway company in selecting and retaining employees, emphasizing the need for proper diligence in ensuring the competency of employees whose actions could pose significant risks to others.
 

 The references do not indicate a direct overruling of Wabash Railway Company v. McDaniels by a subsequent Supreme Court decision. Overruling a Supreme Court decision typically involves a later Supreme Court case explicitly stating that the legal principles or holdings of an earlier case are no longer valid law. Without such a direct statement in the provided references, it can be concluded that Wabash Railway Company v. McDaniels has not been explicitly overruled based on the information available.
 

 It's important to note that while not overruled, the principles established in a case can be refined, reinterpreted, or limited in scope by later cases, even if not directly overruled. However, without specific references to such cases, the status of Wabash Railway Company v. McDaniels as not being explicitly overruled stands based on the provided context.",1,0,0

However, legal principles from cases can be eroded or effectively overruled by later decisions that establish new legal standards or interpretations.
 

 In the context provided, there is a case that mentions an overruling of a different case titled Evans v. Gore, which is United States v. Hatter, 532 U.S. 557 (2001). In United States v. Hatter, the Supreme Court overruled Evans v.

The case was subsequently revisited in *Illinois Central Railroad Company v. Turrill*, 110 U.S. 301, decided on January 28, 1884 [6]. In the 1884 decision, the Supreme Court affirmed its earlier rulings regarding the profits made from the use of infringing machines and reversed its earlier rulings regarding the profits made by the use of machines that were adjudged to be non-infringing [6]. 
 

 However, there is no explicit mention in the provided references of the *Cawood Patent* case being overruled. Overruling a case typically means that the Supreme Court has decided that the legal principles of an earlier case are no longer correct and are therefore no longer a part of the case law.

This case involved Heublein, Inc., a Connecticut corporation that produces alcoholic beverages, and its challenge against the South Carolina Tax Commission's assessment of taxes on income derived from the sale of its goods in South Carolina. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Supreme Court of South Carolina, holding that Heublein's activities within South Carolina exceeded the minimum standards established in 15 U.S.C. 381 (a), allowing South Carolina to tax the income from local sales of Heublein's products.

This case involved a dispute over the duty rates applicable to sheepskins imported with wool on them, under the tariff act of 1846. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, which had charged the importations with a duty of twenty percent ad valorem, classifying the sheepskins as a non-enumerated article not specifically provided for in the act, thus subject to a general duty rate.
 

 It's important to note that the absence of a direct reference to this case being overruled suggests that its specific legal interpretations or the principles it established have not been directly invalidated by a later Supreme Court ruling within the context provided. However, this does not preclude the possibility that broader legal developments, changes in statutory law, or shifts in interpretive approaches by the Court over time could diminish its precedential value or applicability to similar disputes today.",1,0,0

This case involved the interpretation of the Safety Appliance Act, particularly focusing on what constitutes a ""train"" under the Act and the requirement for such trains to have power brakes on a substantial number of cars. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, emphasizing a broad interpretation of the term ""train"" to include movements of assembled units of an engine and a substantial number of cars for substantial distances, even if these movements occur within a classification or assembly yard. 
 

 The decision was grounded in the aim of promoting safety for employees and the public, aligning with the legislative intent behind the Safety Appliance Act. The Court's analysis was based on previous interpretations of the Act and aimed to ensure that the safety measures prescribed by Congress were applied broadly to cover various types of railroad movements that pose similar hazards to those occurring on main lines [1].
 

 Given the information available, there is no indication that the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Seaboard Air Line Railroad Co. has been overruled.

This case involved issues of taxation and equal protection under the law, specifically addressing the actions of a state board of equalization in its assessment of taxes against the Chicago Union Traction Company. The Supreme Court's decision in this case focused on whether the actions of the state board resulted in illegal discrimination and whether such actions violated the Fourteenth Amendment's provisions for equal protection and due process.
 

 The decision detailed the complexities of tax assessment and the role of the state board of equalization, concluding that the board's actions, in this case, did not provide equal protection under the laws as required by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court affirmed the judgment enjoining the collection of the balance of the tax levied against the appellee, above what had been paid under the direction of the Circuit Court, indicating a significant stance on the application of the Fourteenth Amendment to state actions regarding taxation and equalization.
 

 Given the absence of a direct reference to this case being overruled in the provided context, it appears that *Raymond v. Chicago Union Traction Co.* remains a part of the legal landscape regarding the principles of equal protection and due process in the context of state taxation and assessment practices.

San Francisco Savings Union, 136 U.S. 578 (1890), the Supreme Court referenced Wright v. Roseberry to affirm the decision, suggesting that the legal principles established in Wright v. Roseberry were still considered valid at that time [1].
 

 Moreover, the references do not indicate any direct overruling of Wright v. Roseberry. Instead, they provide insights into the case's context and its application in later legal arguments and decisions. For example, the case was referenced in Johnson v. Drew, 171 U.S. 93 (1898), in discussions about the administration of public lands and the finality of decisions made by the land department, further indicating its ongoing relevance and application in legal reasoning [3].
 

 Given the information available, it appears that Wright v. Roseberry remains a part of the legal landscape without being explicitly overruled. If the case had been overruled, such an event would typically be documented in legal databases or subsequent case law, which is not indicated in the provided references.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was The Diana, 74 U.S. 354, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case *The Diana*, 74 U.S. 354, decided in 1868, has not been explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision based on the references provided [2],[3]. The case involved the capture of the schooner Diana and addressed the legality of a neutral vessel attempting to enter a blockaded port, concluding with the vessel and cargo being condemned as lawful prize. Overruling a Supreme Court case typically involves a direct statement in a later case that the principles or rulings of the earlier case are no longer valid law. Without such a statement in the provided references or any mention of a specific case that overruled *The Diana*, it can be concluded that *The Diana* has not been explicitly overruled based on the information available.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was Helvering, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, v.

Powers, Executor, et al.*, 293 U.S. 214, decided on December 3, 1934, has not been explicitly overruled based on the references provided [2][3][4]. The case dealt with the constitutional authority of Congress to lay a tax, specifically addressing the taxation of compensation for personal services, including those conducted by state officers or in enterprises undertaken by the State that are normally within the reach of the federal taxing power. The decision emphasized that the nature of the enterprise, rather than the particular incidents of its management, would control the applicability of federal taxation.
 

 In the context of Supreme Court jurisprudence, a case is considered overruled when a subsequent decision explicitly states that the legal principles or holdings of the earlier case are no longer valid. There is no reference provided that indicates such a subsequent decision explicitly overruling *Helvering v. Powers*. 
 

 It's important to note that the legal landscape is dynamic, and while a case may not be explicitly overruled, later decisions can limit its applicability, reinterpret its principles, or distinguish its facts in a manner that reduces its precedential value. However, based on the information available, *Helvering v. Powers* stands not explicitly overruled as of the last reference provided.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was United States v. Mitchell et Al., Executor, 271 U.S. 9, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case *United States v. Mitchell et al., Executors*, cited as 271 U.S. 9, decided on April 12, 1926, has not been explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision based on the references provided [5]. This case dealt with the deductibility of federal estate taxes and state inheritance taxes from the gross income of an estate for income tax purposes under the Revenue Act of 1918. The Supreme Court's decision in this case was specific to the tax laws and accounting methods applicable at the time.
 

 It's important to note that the legal principles and tax laws discussed in *United States v. Mitchell et al., Executors* may have been affected or modified by later legislation or court decisions. However, without a direct reference to a specific case or legislative act that overruled *United States v. Mitchell et al., Executors*, it's not possible to provide the exact year or context in which it was overruled, if at all.
 

 For a comprehensive understanding of the current state of the law regarding the issues addressed in *United States v. Mitchell et al., Executors*, it would be advisable to consult more recent tax legislation and case law. This would include reviewing updates to the Internal Revenue Code and looking for later Supreme Court cases that might have revisited similar issues.",1,0,0

West Jersey Ferry Company, 114 U.S. 474, decided on April 20, 1885, has not been explicitly overruled based on the references provided [1]. This case involved a dispute over whether the failure of a ferry company to provide sufficient seating for passengers constituted negligence. The Supreme Court held that a general exception to a charge, which does not direct the court's attention to specific objections, raises no question for review. Furthermore, it was determined that the mere failure to provide a seat for a passenger on a ferry boat was not, in itself, proof of negligence unless it was shown that fewer seats were provided than was customary and sufficient for those who ordinarily preferred to be seated while crossing [1].
 

 The references provided do not indicate any subsequent Supreme Court decision that explicitly overrules Burton v. West Jersey Ferry Company. Therefore, based on the information available, it appears that the ruling in Burton v. West Jersey Ferry Company stands as decided in 1885 [1].",1,0,0

It is important to note that not all cases are explicitly overruled; some may simply fall into disuse, be superseded by later cases, or be implicitly overruled without a specific ruling that references the case by name.
 

 If a case is overruled, it is typically done so by a subsequent case that directly addresses the legal principles or holdings of the earlier case and provides a different ruling or interpretation. The references provided do not contain any information about a case that overruled ""The Mary and Susan.""
 

 To determine if ""The Mary and Susan"" was overruled and, if so, in what year, one would need to conduct a thorough legal research beyond the references provided.

Milford Central School, 533 U.S. 98, has not been overruled. The decision in this case, rendered on June 11, 2001, held that the exclusion of the Good News Club from meeting after hours at the school violated the Club's free speech rights and that no Establishment Clause concern justified that violation [2],[3],[4],[8],[9]. 
 

 Since the decision, there have been no subsequent Supreme Court rulings that have overruled or fundamentally altered the legal principles established in Good News Club v. Milford Central School. The case is still cited in later Supreme Court decisions, such as in Shurtleff v. City of Boston, Mass., where the Court reiterated that a government does not violate the Establishment Clause merely because it treats religious persons, organizations, and speech equally with secular counterparts in public programs and facilities [1]. 
 

 Therefore, as of the current date, the Good News Club case remains good law and has not been overruled by the Supreme Court.",1,0,0

Frohman, 223 U.S. 424, decided on February 19, 1912, has not been overruled according to the information provided in the references [1],[2],[3],[4]. This case involved a dispute over copyright and the public performance rights of a dramatic work, with the Supreme Court ultimately affirming the decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois. The case established important principles regarding copyright law and the rights of authors to control the public performance of their works in the United States.
 

 The decision in Ferris v. Frohman focused on the exclusive rights of authors and copyright holders, distinguishing between the rights to copy and distribute works and the rights to public performance. It clarified that the public performance of a manuscript drama in the United States does not constitute publication, thereby allowing the author to retain exclusive representation rights. This ruling has implications for copyright law, particularly in distinguishing between different types of copyrightable works and the rights associated with them.
 

 Given the absence of information indicating that Ferris v. Frohman has been overruled, it stands as a significant case in the realm of copyright law, particularly concerning the rights of authors over the public performance of their works.",1,0,0

Algoma Lumber Co., 305 U.S. 415, decided in 1939, has not been overruled according to the information provided in the references [1],[2]. The case dealt with contracts for the sale of timber on Indian reservation lands and whether such contracts constituted obligations of the United States. The Supreme Court held that they were not contracts of the United States and, therefore, a suit against the United States to recover alleged overpayments made under such contracts was not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims [1],[2].
 

 If the case had been overruled, it would typically be noted in subsequent cases that reference it, indicating a change in the legal landscape. However, none of the provided references indicate that United States v. Algoma Lumber Co. has been overruled. It is important to note that the absence of information indicating that the case has been overruled does not definitively prove that it has not been; it simply means that within the provided references, there is no record of such an event. If the case had been overruled, it would likely be a significant point of discussion in legal texts and subsequent case law, which is not evident here.",1,0,0

Ripley for compensation for services and disbursements made while he was in the military service of the United States [1][2][3]. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the district court, which had allowed Ripley's claims, and remanded the case for further proceedings [3].
 

 The references do not contain information about this case being overruled at a later date. To determine if and when the case was overruled, one would need to conduct further research into subsequent Supreme Court decisions or changes in relevant statutes that might have affected the legal standing of the case.

Dix et al., citation 47 U.S. 507, decided in 1848, has not been overruled. The case dealt with the exercise of the eminent domain power by the State of Vermont, where the state took private property for public use, specifically a bridge owned by The West River Bridge Company. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Vermont Supreme Court, holding that the taking of the bridge did not violate the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution because it was a legitimate exercise of the state's eminent domain power and appropriate compensation was provided [9].
 

 The case is significant because it established that the government's right to take private property for public use under the power of eminent domain includes the power to take a franchise granted to a private corporation when necessary for public purposes, provided just compensation is made. This decision has not been overruled and remains a part of the legal framework governing eminent domain in the United States.",1,0,0

Booth* (62 U.S. 506, 1858) has not been explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision. This case, decided in 1858, addressed the conflict between federal and state authority, particularly in the context of the Fugitive Slave Act and state efforts to resist its enforcement. The Supreme Court affirmed the supremacy of federal law over state law, ruling that state courts cannot issue rulings that contradict federal law, including the Fugitive Slave Act [1][2][3][4][5][6].
 

 The principles upheld in *Ableman v. Booth* regarding the supremacy of federal law over state law remain a foundational aspect of United States constitutional law. However, the specific context of the Fugitive Slave Act and the issues surrounding slavery were rendered moot by the Civil War and the subsequent amendments to the Constitution, particularly the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery.
 

 While *Ableman v. Booth* itself has not been overruled, the legal and social context in which it was decided has dramatically changed, rendering its specific application to fugitive slave laws obsolete.

 It's important to note that the evolution of maritime law and salvage rights may have seen significant developments since 1841 through other cases, legislation, or international treaties that could implicitly modify or refine the legal principles established in the Houseman case. However, without specific reference to a case that explicitly overrules it, we cannot definitively say that the Houseman case has been overruled.
 

 For a comprehensive understanding of the current state of maritime salvage law and how the principles established in the Houseman case have been applied or modified over time, it would be beneficial to review more recent cases, legal commentaries, and maritime law treaties. Additionally, consulting a legal database or maritime law specialist could provide more detailed insights into the case's standing and its relevance to contemporary maritime law practices.",1,0,0

United States, 266 U.S. 108, decided on November 17, 1924, has not been explicitly overruled based on the provided references [1]. This case involved a dispute over the jurisdiction of the District Court in a libel in personam against the United States for a claim that could have been enforced against the vessel itself under the Act of 1916, considering the provisions of the Act of 1920. The Supreme Court's decision in this case focused on the interpretation of specific provisions of the Suits in Admiralty Act and the equitable purpose of Congress, rather than establishing a broad legal principle that would be subject to being overruled by subsequent cases.
 

 Further examination of the subsequent case, James Shewan Sons, Inc. v. United States, 267 U.S. 86, decided on March 2, 1925, shows it as a continuation of the legal proceedings related to the same parties and issues, rather than an overruling of the previous decision. This case addressed the entitlement of the libelant to costs and interest following the Supreme Court's reversal of the District Court's dismissal of the libel [2]. 
 

 The references provided do not indicate that the Supreme Court or any other court has overruled the decision in James Shewan & Sons, Inc. v. United States, 266 U.S. 108. Overruling a Supreme Court decision would require either a subsequent Supreme Court decision that explicitly states it is overruling a previous case or legislation that changes the legal landscape, making the previous decision no longer applicable. None of the provided references suggest that either of these circumstances has occurred in relation to James Shewan & Sons, Inc. v. United States, 266 U.S. 108 [1][2].

Betsey Herbert and Caroline Herbert, Defendants in Error, 46 U.S. 72* was decided in 1847 [1]. This case involved a dispute over a deed of manumission, where George Miller intended to grant freedom to Betsey Herbert and Caroline Herbert, who were claimed as part of his estate upon his death. The court ultimately found in favor of the Herberts, affirming their freedom.
 

 Regarding the specific query about when this case was overruled, the provided references do not contain information about this case being explicitly overruled. Supreme Court decisions can be overruled by later Supreme Court decisions that directly contradict the legal principles or findings of a previous case. However, without specific reference to a later case that overrules *Miller v. Herbert*, it's not possible to provide a year or context for such an action.
 

 It's important to note that the evolution of law, especially concerning issues of freedom, manumission, and civil rights, has seen significant changes since 1847. The legal landscape regarding such matters has been profoundly affected by subsequent legislation and court decisions, particularly those surrounding the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement. However, without a direct reference to a case that overrules *Miller v. Herbert*, any discussion on the matter would be speculative.
 

 For a comprehensive understanding of how and if *Miller v. Herbert* has been overruled or affected by later legal developments, a detailed review of subsequent Supreme Court cases, legislation, and legal scholarship would be necessary. This would involve examining cases that address similar legal issues or principles and determining whether they explicitly negate the findings or legal reasoning of the *Miller v.

Based on the references provided, there is no direct information indicating that this specific case was ever explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision. 
 

 Supreme Court decisions are binding and set precedents unless they are overruled by the Court in a later case. The process of a case being overruled involves a direct challenge to the principles or findings of the case in a later case, where the Court then decides to depart from the precedent set by the earlier case. This can happen due to changes in societal values, legal philosophies, or the composition of the Court. However, not every Supreme Court decision is explicitly overruled; some may simply become less relevant over time or be distinguished in such a way that their applicability is limited without being directly overruled.
 

 Given the information available, it appears that W. S. Tyler Company v. Ludlow-Saylor Wire Company has not been explicitly overruled. For the most accurate and current information, it would be advisable to consult legal databases or resources that track the status of Supreme Court precedents and their treatment in subsequent jurisprudence.",1,0,0

The references available do not contain any information about this case being explicitly overruled or superseded by a subsequent Supreme Court decision. 
 

 In legal practice, a case is considered overruled when a later court decision contradicts or changes the legal precedent established by the earlier case. This can happen through a direct overruling where the court explicitly states that the previous case is no longer good law, or through implication, where the principles of a case are so undermined by later developments that its authority is effectively nullified. 
 

 Without specific information indicating that Owens v. Hanney has been overruled, it stands that the case's legal principles and outcomes remain part of the body of U.S. law, unless contradicted by later cases not provided in the references.

This case involved a dispute over a policy of insurance against fire, with significant discussion on the admissibility of parol evidence and the effect of representations made by a party originally insured on the assignees of the policy. The court's decision focused on the principles of insurance law, particularly regarding representations and their adoption by subsequent policyholders.
 

 The references do not indicate any subsequent Supreme Court decision that directly overruled the 1850 decision. It's important to note that the Supreme Court's decisions are binding and remain in effect unless explicitly overruled by the Court in a later decision or rendered obsolete by legislative action. Without specific reference to a case that overruled the 1850 decision, it stands as part of the body of U.S. case law.

fake_year_overruled,"What year was Maine v. Grand Trunk Railway Company, 142 U.S. 217, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case Maine v. Grand Trunk Railway Company, 142 U.S. 217, decided in 1891, has not been explicitly overruled according to the references provided. The case dealt with the power of a state to tax a foreign corporation operating a railroad partly within and partly without the state [1][2][3][6]. The decision upheld the state's power to levy such a tax, and it was not deemed a regulation of interstate commerce that would conflict with the exclusive power of Congress [6].
 

 The case has been cited in subsequent decisions as authority on the matter of state taxation of corporations operating across state lines [5]. However, none of the references indicate that the Supreme Court has overruled the 1891 decision in Maine v. Grand Trunk Railway Company. Instead, the case has been distinguished from others, suggesting that its principles were not applicable in certain other contexts but not that it was overruled [7].
 

 If the case had been overruled, it would typically be noted in subsequent cases that discuss or rely on the same legal issues. Since there is no such indication in the references provided, it can be concluded that as of the information available, Maine v. Grand Trunk Railway Company has not been overruled.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was Hauge v. Chicago, 299 U.S. 387, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The case Hauge v. Chicago, 299 U.S. 387, was decided by the Supreme Court on January 4, 1937 [1][2]. The information provided does not include any details about this case being overruled. To determine if and when Hauge v. Chicago was overruled, one would typically look for subsequent Supreme Court decisions or changes in relevant laws that explicitly overrule the 1937 decision. Since the provided references do not contain such information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer to your question based on the available context.
 

 If you are seeking information on whether Hauge v. Chicago has been overruled, you may need to conduct further research into Supreme Court decisions after 1937, legal databases, or consult legal professionals who can provide access to comprehensive legal resources.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was Weaver v. Palmer Brothers Company, 270 U.S. 402, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case Weaver v. Palmer Brothers Company, 270 U.S. 402, decided on March 8, 1926, has not been explicitly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision based on the references provided [1],[2],[3],[4]. This case involved the constitutionality of a Pennsylvania statute regulating the use of shoddy (recycled wool) in the manufacture of comfortables (quilts), which the Supreme Court found to be an arbitrary prohibition violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The decision was significant for its time, addressing issues of public health, consumer protection, and the limits of state regulatory power under the guise of the police power.
 

 It's important to note that the Supreme Court's decisions are binding and set precedent unless the Court itself decides to overrule a previous decision or unless legislation is passed that effectively nullifies the decision's impact, subject to constitutional constraints. The absence of a direct reference to Weaver v. Palmer Brothers Company being overruled suggests that its legal principles may still hold unless specific, later cases have implicitly overruled or significantly limited its applicability without directly referencing it. However, without explicit information on such cases, the status of Weaver as not being overruled stands based on the provided context.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was Chicago & North Western Railway Co. et al. v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. et al., 387 U.S. 326, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case Chicago & North Western Railway Co. et al. v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. et al., 387 U.S. 326, decided on May 29, 1967, has not been explicitly overruled according to the references provided [1][2][3][6][7]. Overruling a Supreme Court decision would require a subsequent Supreme Court ruling that directly contradicts the legal principles or conclusions of the original case, effectively nullifying its precedent. The references do not indicate any such subsequent Supreme Court decision that has overruled the 1967 case.
 

 It is important to note that while Supreme Court decisions can be overruled, such occurrences are relatively rare and typically involve significant shifts in legal perspectives or societal values. If the case had been overruled, it would be a notable event likely documented in legal databases and subsequent case law. Since the references do not provide any information about the case being overruled, it stands to reason that the decision from 1967 remains valid. If you require confirmation beyond the references provided, you may need to conduct further research into more recent Supreme Court decisions or legal databases that track the status of case law.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was Cucullu v. Hernandez, 103 U.S. 105, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case *Cucullu v. Hernandez*, 103 U.S. 105, decided in 1880, has not been explicitly overruled based on the references provided [1][2][3][4]. The case dealt with the validity of mortgages and their inscription or reinscription under Louisiana law, specifically in the context of a dispute over the priority of payment from the sale of mortgaged lands. The Supreme Court's decision in this case focused on the specific legal and factual circumstances surrounding the mortgages on the Myrtle Grove Plantation, including issues of prescription (the extinguishment of rights or claims through the lapse of time), the effect of non-reinscription of mortgages, and the priority of claims against the proceeds from the sale of the mortgaged property.
 

 Given the nature of your question and the information available, there is no indication that the principles or holdings of *Cucullu v. Hernandez* have been directly overruled by a subsequent Supreme Court decision. It's important to note that the overruling of a Supreme Court case typically involves a clear statement by the Court in a later case that the earlier case's legal principles or holdings are no longer valid. Without such a statement or a specific case citation indicating that *Cucullu v. Hernandez* has been overruled, it should be considered as still standing.
 

 If your interest in whether *Cucullu v. Hernandez* has been overruled is related to a specific legal issue or principle discussed in the case, it may be beneficial to look into more recent cases or legal commentaries that address similar issues. Legal principles, especially those related to property law, mortgages, and the effects of non-reinscription, can evolve over time through legislative changes or judicial interpretation, even if a specific case has not been formally overruled.",1,0,0
fake_year_overruled,"What year was Mayor and Aldermen of the City of Mobile, Plaintiffs, v. J. Emanuel and G. S. Gaines, Defendants, 42 U.S. 95, overruled?",This case has not been overruled.,"The Supreme Court case Mayor and Aldermen of the City of Mobile, Plaintiffs, v. J. Emanuel and G. S. Gaines, Defendants, 42 U.S. 95, was not explicitly overruled in a subsequent Supreme Court decision based on the references provided. However, it's important to understand the context and implications of this case to grasp its standing and how it has been treated in later legal developments.
 

 The case, decided in 1843, involved a dispute over land titles between the City of Mobile and private parties, Emanuel and Gaines. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Supreme Court of Alabama, which had ruled in favor of Emanuel and Gaines. The case centered around the interpretation of Congressional acts and Spanish grants concerning land titles in the area that became the city of Mobile, Alabama [1].
 

 Subsequent cases and legal developments have evolved the principles of property law, municipal authority, and the interpretation of Congressional acts, but there is no direct reference to this specific case being overruled. The evolution of legal principles over time means that the relevance and applicability of older cases like this one can diminish as new precedents are set and legal frameworks are updated.
 

 It's also worth noting that the Supreme Court's approach to property rights, municipal powers, and related issues has evolved significantly since the mid-19th century. However, without a specific ruling that explicitly overrules Mayor and Aldermen of the City of Mobile v. J. Emanuel and G. S. Gaines, it remains a part of the historical record of Supreme Court jurisprudence.
 

 For a comprehensive understanding of how this case fits into the current legal landscape, it would be beneficial to consult more recent cases and legal analyses that discuss the evolution of the relevant legal principles.",1,0,0

The decision in this case was rendered on June 6, 2016, and there is no information provided in the references indicating that it has been overruled [1],[2]. It is important to note that overruling a Supreme Court decision would require a subsequent Supreme Court ruling that expressly overturns the earlier decision, and no such subsequent ruling has been identified in the provided references.",1,0,0

The references given pertain to *Dam v. Kirk La Shelle Co.*, 175 F. 902 (1910), which was decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Unfortunately, without specific information on *In Re Schmidt* within the provided context, I cannot directly answer your question regarding who wrote the majority opinion for that case.
 

 For *Dam v. Kirk La Shelle Co.*, the references do not include explicit information about the authorship of the majority opinion either. Typically, the authorship of an opinion is attributed to a specific judge or is noted as per curiam when it is delivered by the court collectively without specifying an individual author. Since the references provided do not detail the judges involved in *Dam v. Kirk La Shelle Co.* beyond mentioning Circuit Judges Coxe, Ward, and Noyes in the context of another case, and do not specify who wrote the opinion, I cannot provide a direct answer based on the information available.
 

 If you're looking for details on the authorship of opinions in cases decided by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals around the same time, it might be beneficial to consult legal databases or archives that provide comprehensive historical records of court opinions. These resources often include detailed information about the judges who authored opinions, as well as the opinions themselves.",0,0,1
